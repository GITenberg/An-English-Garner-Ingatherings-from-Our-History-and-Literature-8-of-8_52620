<p>[The passage referred to runs thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the Parliament was finished and that matter
concluded; the King (considering the constant zeal of
the Archbishop in defence of his cause; and partly also
weighing the many authorities and reasons whereby he
had substantially confirmed the same) sent [in July 1539]
the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> (which within a few days after [<i>or
rather on 10th June 1540</i>] was apprehended), the two
Dukes of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span> and
<span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>, and all the Lords of
the Parliament, to dine with him at Lambeth: where
they signified to him, That it was the King's pleasure
that they all should, in His Highness's behalf, cherish
comfort and animate him as one that, for his travail in
that Parliament, had declared himself both greatly learned,
and also a man discreet and wise: and therefore they
willed him not to be discouraged in anything that was
passed in that Parliament contrary to his allegations.</p>

<p>He most humbly thanked, first the King's Highness
of his singular good affection towards him; and them,
for all their pains: adding moreover that he so hoped
in GOD that hereafter his allegations and authorities
should take place, to the glory of GOD and commodity
of the realm.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereupon, when this dinner was finished [in July 1539],
the next day after the Archbishop (collecting
both his arguments, authorities of Scripture, and
Doctors [<i>i.e. the Fathers of the Church</i>] together)

<span class="sidenote">The name of
this Secretary was Master <span class="smcap">Ralph
Morice</span>, being yet alive [<i>i.e., in 1570</i>].</span>
caused his Secretary to write a fair Book thereof
for the King, after this order:</p>

<p>First, the Scriptures were alleged.</p>

<p>Then, the Doctors.</p>

<p>Thirdly, followed the arguments deduced from those
Authorities.</p>

<p>This book was written in his Secretary's Chamber [at
Lambeth Palace]; where, in a by-chamber, lay the Archbishop's
Almoner.</p>

<p>When this Book was fair written, and while the Secretary
was gone to deliver the same unto the Archbishop his
Master, who was, as it chanced, ridden to Croydon;
returning back to his chamber, he found his door shut,
and the key carried away to London by the Almoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>At this season also [it] chanced the father of the said
Secretary to come to the city; by whose occasion it
so fell out, that he [<span class="smcap">Ralph Morice</span>] must needs go to
London. The Book he could not lay in his chamber, neither
durst he commit it to any other person to keep; being
straitly charged, in any condition, by the Archbishop his
master, to be circumspect thereof: so he determined to go
to his father, and to keep the Book about him.</p>

<p>And so, thrusting the Book under his girdle, he went
over [the Thames] unto Westminster Bridge, with a
sculler; where he entered into a wherry that went to
London: wherein were four of the Guard, who meant to
land at Paul's Wharf; and to pass by the King's Highness
who was then in his barge, with a great number of barges
and boats about him, then baiting of bears in the water,
over against the Bank [Side in Southwark].</p>

<p>The aforesaid Yeomen of the Guard, when they came
against the King's barge, they durst not pass by towards
Paul's Wharf, lest they should be espied: and therefore
entreated the Secretary to go with them to the Bearbaiting;
and they would find the means, being of the Guard, to
make room and to see all the pastime.</p>

<p>The Secretary perceiving no other remedy, assented
thereto.</p>

<p>When the wherry came nigh the multitude of boats;
they with poleaxes got the wherry so far that, being
encompassed with many other wherries and boats, there
was no refuge if the bear should break loose and come upon
them: as, in very deed, within one <i>Paternoster</i> while,
the bear brake loose; and came into the boat where the
Yeomen of the Guard were, and the said Secretary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tall Yeomen, but ill Keepers.</div>

<p>The Guard forsook the wherry, and went into
another barge; one or two of them leaping short,
so fell into the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bearbaiting upon [the] Thames before the King.</div>

<p>The bear and the dogs so shaked the wherry wherein
the Secretary was, that the boat being full of water sank
to the ground; and being also, as it chanced, an ebbing
tide, he sat there in the end of the wherry up to
the middle in water. To whom came the bear
and all the dogs. The bear, seeking as it were
aid and succour of him, came back with his hinder parts

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote">The Book of
Dr <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>
against the <i>Six
Articles</i> lost
in the Thames.</span>

upon him; and so, rushing upon him, the Book was loosed
from the Secretary's girdle, and so fell into the
Thames out of his reach.</p>

<p>The flying of the people, after that the bear was
loose, from one boat to another, was so cumbrous that divers
persons were thrown into the Thames: the King commanding
certain men, that could swim, to strip themselves naked;
and to help to save them that were in danger.</p>

<p>This pastime so displeased the King, that he bade,
"Away, away with the bear! and let us go all hence!"</p>

<p>The Secretary, perceiving his Book to fleet away in
the Thames, called to the Bearward to take up the Book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This Bearward
was Princess <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s
servant.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dr <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>'s
Book against the <i>Six Articles</i>
delivered to a Popish Priest.</div>

<p>When the Bearward had the Book in his custody, being
an arrant Papist, far from the religion of his
Mistress (for he was the Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s
Bearward, now the Queen's Majesty), ere that the
Secretary could come to land, he had delivered the Book to a
Priest of his own affinity in religion standing on
the bank: who, reading in the Book, and
perceiving that it was a manifest Refutation of the
<i>Six Articles</i>, made much ado; and told the Bearward
that whosoever claimed the Book, should surely be hanged.</p>

<p>Anon, the Secretary came to the Bearward for his Book.</p>

<p>"What," quoth the Bearward, "dare you challenge this
Book? Whose servant be you?"</p>

<p>"I am servant to one of the [Privy] Council," said the
Secretary, "and my Lord of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> is my master."</p>

<p>"Yea, marry," quoth the Bearward, "I thought as much.
You be like, I trust, to be both hanged for this Book."</p>

<p>"Well," said he "it is not so evil as you take it: and,
I warrant you, my Lord will avouch the book to the King's
Majesty. But I pray you let me have my Book, and I
will give you a crown [<i>6s., or in present value about &pound;2</i>]
to drink."</p>

<p>"If you will give me 500 crowns, you shall not have it,"
quoth the Bearward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With that the Secretary departed from him: and, understanding
the malicious forwardness of the Bearward, he
learned that <span class="smcap">Blage</span> the Grocer in Cheapside might do
much with him. To whom the Secretary brake this matter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
requiring him to send for the Bearward to supper; and
he would pay for the whole charge thereof: and besides
that, rather than he would forego his Book after this
sort, the Bearward should have 20s. [<i>in present value about
&pound;6</i>] to drink.</p>

<p>The supper was prepared. The Bearward was sent for,
and came. After supper, the matter was intreated; and 20s.
offered for the Book.</p>

<p>But do what could be done; neither friendship, acquaintance,
nor yet reward of money, could obtain the Book
out of his hands: but that the same should be delivered
unto some of the [Privy] Council, that would not so slightly
look on so weighty a matter as to have it redeemed for
a supper, or a piece of money. The honest man, Master
<span class="smcap">Blage</span>, with many good reasons would have persuaded him
not to be stiff in his own conceit: declaring that in the end
he should nothing at all prevail of his purpose, but be
laughed to scorn; getting neither penny nor praise for
his travail. He, hearing that, rushed suddenly out of
the doors from his friend Master <span class="smcap">Blage</span>; without any
manner of thanksgiving for his supper: more like a
Bearward than like an honest man.</p>

<p>When the Secretary saw the matter so extremely to
be used against him; he then thought it expedient to
fall from any farther practising of entreaty with the Bearward,
as with him that seemed rather to be a bear himself
than master of the beast: determining the next morning to
make the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> privy of the chance that
happened.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So, on the next day, as the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> went to
the Court, the Secretary declared the whole matter unto
him; and how he had offered the Bearward 20s. for the
finding thereof.</p>

<p>"Where is the fellow?" quoth the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the Secretary, "that he is now in
the Court, attending to deliver the book unto some of the
Council."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, "it maketh no matter.
Go with me thither, and I shall get you your book
again!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bearward
waiting to give
<span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>'s
Book to the
Council.</div>

<p>When the Lord Cromwell came into the Hall of the
Court, there stood the Bearward with the Book
in his hand; waiting to have delivered the same
unto Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Browne</span> or unto [<span class="smcap">Stephen
Gardiner</span>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, as it was reported.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>
getteth the
Book from
the Bearward.</div>

<p>To whom the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> said, "Come hither,
fellow! What Book hast thou there in thy hand?" and
with that snatched the Book out of his hand: and
looking in the Book, said, "I know this hand well
enough. This is your hand," said he to the
Secretary.</p>

<p>"But where hadst thou this Book?" quoth the Lord
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> to the Bearward.</p>

<p>"This Gentleman lost it two days ago in the Thames,"
said the Bearward.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know whose servant he is?" said the Lord
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>.</p>

<p>"He saith," quoth the Bearward, "that he is my Lord
of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>'s servant."</p>

<p>"Why then didst thou not deliver to him the Book
when he required it?" said the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>. "Who made
thee so bold as to detain or withhold any Book or writing from
a Councillor's servant, especially being his Secretary? It is
more meet for thee to meddle with thy bears, than with
such writing: and were it not for thy Mistress's sake, I
would set thee fast by the feet, to teach such malapert
knaves to meddle with Councillors' matters. Had not
money been well bestowed upon such a good fellow as this
is, that knoweth not a Councillor's man from a cobbler's
man!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And with those words, the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> went up
into the King's Chamber of Presence, and the Archbishop's
Secretary with him: where he found, in the Chamber,
the Lord of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The words of
the Lord
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> to
the Archbishop
<span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>.</div>

<p>To whom he said, "My Lord, I have here found good
stuff for you," showing to him the paper book that
he had in his hand, "ready to bring both you, and
this good fellow your man, to the halter: namely
[<i>especially</i>] if the knave Bearward, now in the Hall, might
have well compassed it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>At these words, the Archbishop smiled, and said, "He
that lost the Book is like[ly] to have the worst bargain:
for, besides that he was well washed in the Thames, he must
write the Book fair again."</p>

<p>And, at these words, the Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> cast the Book
unto the Secretary, saying, "I pray thee, <span class="smcap">Morice</span>, go in
hand therewith, by and bye, with all expedition: for it
must serve a turn."</p>

<p>"Surely, my Lord, it somewhat rejoiceth me," quoth the
Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, "that the varlet might have had of your
man 20s. for the Book: and now I have discharged the
matter with never a penny; and shaken him well up for his
overmuch malapertness."</p>

<p>"I know the fellow well enough," quoth the Archbishop,
"there is not a ranker Papist within this realm than he is;
most unworthy to be a servant unto so noble a Princess."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so, after humble thanks given to the Lord
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, the said <span class="smcap">Morice</span> departed with his Book:
which, when he again had fair written it, was delivered
to the King's Majesty by the said Lord <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, within
four days after.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[In <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s Rebellion, there was as much a social strife as a political
conflict. Like the Rebellions of the previous reign, it was largely a
rising of the Masses against the Classes. The Kentish Gentlemen and
their dependents were mostly Horsemen, and went for Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.
The Kentish commons were chiefly Footmen, and many of them went
for <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<p>This Rebellion was nipped in the bud, because the Kentish commons
were prevented from joining hands with the lower classes of London.
Had they been able to do so, it would have been the days of <span class="smcap">Wat
Tyler</span> over again.</p>

<p>It is clear that, as stated at page <a href="#Page_66">66</a>, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> thought that the Footmen
opposed to him would come over to his side. This is probably the reason
why the action at Hyde Park Corner was so indecisive, see pages
<a href="#Page_87">87</a> to 89. Lord <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> could not trust his Footmen; so only the
Horsemen fought there against <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proctor</span> was undoubtedly an affectionately loyal subject of Queen
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, and magnifies her herein upon every possible occasion. He
says himself at p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>, that he has "not fully set forth the whole case,
all as it was." He wrote too soon after the event to do so in print.</p>

<p>At Vol. IV., pp. 88-93, of this Series, we have given a Protestant
account of this Rising by <span class="smcap">Edward Underhill</span>, the "Hot Gospeller":
and at pp. 112-142 of the same Volume will be found Fox's account of
the Imprisonment of the Princess <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, which was occasioned by
this Rebellion; though <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, with his dying breath, cleared her of all
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>All these narratives should be compared with the account in Professor
<span class="smcap">Froude</span>'s <i>History</i>.

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:0.2em;">IT</span> hath been allowed, most gracious Sovereign,
for a necessary policy in all Ages, as stories
do witness, that the flagitious enterprises of
the wicked, which have at any time attempted
with traitorous force to subvert or alter the Public
State of their countries, as also the wise and virtuous
policies of the good practised to preserve the Common
Weal and to repel the enemies of the same, should by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
writing be committed to eternal memory. Partly that they
of that Age in whose time such things happened might by
the oft reading conceive a certain gladness in considering
with themselves, and beholding as it were in a glass, from
what calamity and extreme ruin, by what policy and
wisdom, their native countries were delivered; besides the
great misery and peril they themselves have escaped: partly
for a doctrine and a monition serving both for the present
and future time. But chiefly and principally that the
traitors themselves (who, through hatred to their Prince or
country, shall, either of their own malicious disposition be
stirred; or else by other perverse counsel thereunto induced)
may always have before their eyes the miserable end that
happeneth as just reward to all such caytives [<i>caitiffs</i>] as,
either of ambition not satisfied with their own state will
seek preposterously to aspire to honour; or of malice to
their Prince, will enter into that horrible crime of Privy
Conspiracy or Open Rebellion.</p>

<p>The industry of Writers doth sufficiently declare in a
number of stories that conspiracy and treason hath always
turned to the authors a wretched and miserable end: and if
their persons happen at any time to escape temporal
punishment, as rarely they have done; yet their names,
specially of the notorious and principal offenders, have
been always had in such vile and odible detestation in all
Ages and among all nations as, for the same, they have
been ever after abhorred of all good men.</p>

<p>These general considerations, moving others to indict
[<i>endite</i>] and pen stories, moved me also to gather together
and to register for memory the marvellous practice of
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> his detestable Rebellion; little inferior to the most
dangerous reported in any history, either for desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
courage in the author, or for the monstrous end purposed by
his Rebellion.</p>

<p>Yet I thought nothing less at the beginning than to
publish the same at this time, or at this Age: minding
only to gather notes thereof, where the truth might
be best known, for the which I made earnest and
diligent investigation; and to leave them to be published
by others hereafter, to the behoof of our posterity.</p>

<p>But hearing the sundry tales thereof, far dissonant in
the utterance, and many of them as far wide from truth,
fashioned from the speakers to advance, or deprave, as
they fantased [<i>favoured</i>] the parties; and understanding
besides what notable infamy sprang of this Rebellion to
the whole country of Kent, and to every member of the
same, where sundry and many of them, to mine own
knowledge, shewed themselves most faithful and worthy
subjects, as by the story [it]self shall evidently appear,
which either of haste or of purpose were omitted in a
printed book late[ly] set forth at Canterbury.
<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I thought
these to be special considerations whereby I ought, of
duty to my country [<i>County</i>], to compile and digest such
notes as I had gathered concerning that Rebellion, in some
form or fashion of History; and to publish the same in
this Age, and at this present, contrary to my first intent:
as well that the very truth of that rebellious enterprise
might be thoroughly known, as that also the Shire where
that vile Rebellion was practised might, by opening the full
truth in some part, be delivered from the infamy which, as
by report I hear, is made so general in other Shires as
though very few of Kent were free from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s conspiracy.</p>

[<i>partially</i>]; but to set forth each man's doings

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em"><span class="smcap">THe</span> safe and sure recordation of pains and perils
past hath present delectation, saith <span class="smcap">Tully</span>.
For things, were they never so bitter and unpleasant
in the execution, being after in peace
and security renewed by report or chronicle, are both
plausible [<i>praiseworthy</i>] and profitable, whether they
touched ourselves or others.</span></p>

<p>Being thus in this point persuaded, loving Reader, I
thought it a travail neither unpleasant for thee, nor unthankful
for me, to contrive the late Rebellion practised
by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> in form of a Chronicle, as thou seest. Whereby
as I mean not to please the evil, nor displease the good;
so I much desire to amend the one by setting before his
eye the lamentable Image of hateful Rebellion, for the
increase of obedience; and to help the other by setting
forth the unspotted loyalty of such as adventurously and
faithfully served in this dangerous time, for the increase of
knowledge and policy the better to repress the like dangers,
if any hereafter happen.</p>

<p>And further, although hereby I covet not to renew a fear
of a danger past, yet would I gladly increase a care and
study in every good man's heart to avoid a like danger that
may happen, and most times happeneth; when a danger
with much difficulty avoided is not sufficient warning to
beware of the next.</p>

<p>I have forborne to touch any man by name, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> only
except; and a few others which the story would not permit
to be left out. Yet take me not that I mean to excuse any
man's fault thereby. For what, should I shew myself so
ungrate or unnatural unto my natural countrymen; as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
namely to blaze them to the World whom, either their own
good hap or the Queen's surpassing mercy, would to be
covered at this time?</p>

<p>And although I touch some by name, terming them in
certain places "traitors and rebels," just titles of their
deserts: yet, GOD is my witness!, I do it not of malice
or envy to any of their persons. I never hated any of
them; no, not <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> himself! whom, although he was
utterly unknown unto me, yet for the sundry and singular
gifts wherewith he was largely endued, I had him in great
admiration. And now I rather pity his unhappy case than
malice his person: and do much lament that so many good
and commendable qualities were abused in the service of
cursed Heresy; whose reward was never other than shameful
confusion, by one way or other, to all that followed her
ways.</p>

<p>Finally, if thou suppose I have not fully set forth the
whole case, all as it was, I shall not againsay it; neither
thought I it necessary so to do; but rather so much as
for this time might be both plausible [<i>praiseworthy</i>] and
profitable, and should satisfy such points as in the <i>Dedicatory
Epistle</i> to the Queen's Majesty are expressed.</p>

<p>Hereafter it may be that further be said touching this
matter. In mean time thou hast no just cause, I trust,
to be offended with this my present enterprise, either for
the manner of handling or for the matter herein handled:
the one having sufficient perspicuity and plainness, the other
full truth; for which I have made such diligent investigation,
as I have found it and have herein expressed the
same, especially so much as concerneth Kent.</p>

of the Bohemians and Germans, with all others treating of

as it should evidently seem by the trade of his life
and the late disclosing of himself, was so fervently
affected to heresy, although he laboured by false
persuasion otherwise to have coloured it; that, burning
inwardly with a prepensed treason in his breast for the continuance
of the same within the realm, he persuaded to
himself such an impossibility therein (the Queen's Highness
prospering and bearing the sceptre of high governance) as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

could by no means be brought about without rebellion: the
<span class="sidenote">Rebellion, the only refuge of heretics.</span>
only refuge, as I said, that indurate heretics have
always sought, for maintenance of their heresy;
living under a Catholic Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> persuaded
that
the Queen and
Heresy could
not reign
together.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s repair
to London to
stir others to
his Rebellion.</div>

<p>He therefore, being thus inflamed, could no longer contain,
but immediately upon the beginning of the Queen's
most happy reign, forsaking his habitation in the
country, went to London of purpose to stir
[<span class="smcap">Henry Grey</span>], the Duke of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span> and his
brethren, with others of power in further countries [<i>Counties</i>],
whom he knew to be like affected to heresies and
consequently to burn in sembable desire for continuance
of the same: leaving nevertheless such
behind him in Kent, to solicit his and their unhappy case;
whom he knew so much addicted thereunto as, in his absence,
for their diligence in such a ministry needed no overseer.</p>

<p>He remained in London till he thought himself thoroughly
furnished every way, and everywhere within the realm, to
attempt his determined enterprise; when apt time should
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s return
into Kent.</span>
serve. Which done, he returned into Kent: not
of purpose then to proceed; but, understanding
his strength, practised there by his agents to set things in
order, and so to return to London; abiding the time
appointed therefore by him and his complices.</p>

<p>But, so it befell, in the mean time, that, at his being in the
country, the [Privy] Council committed a Gentleman of that
Shire to ward, one to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> above all others most dear:
whereby the common bruit grew that he, (suspecting his
secrets to be revealed, and upon that occasion to be sent for
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> preventeth
the time.</span> by the Council) felt himself, as it were for his own surety,
compelled to anticipate his time. But whether
that were the cause or no, doubtful it is.</p>

<p>But certain it was that <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, then proceeding in his
detestable purpose, armed himself and as many as he could:
and, giving intelligence of his determination to his complices,
as well at London as elsewhere, the
<span class="sidenote">The first day of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s stir,
at Maidstone.</span>
Thursday after, at Maidstone, in the market time,
being the 25th day of January [1554], in the first year of the
Queen's reign, by Proclamation in writing, published his
devilish pretence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause why
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> made
not Religion
the outward
pretence of
his Rebellion.</div>

<p>And considering with himself that to make the pretence
of his Rebellion to be the restoring or continuance
of the new and newly-forged Religion was neither
agreeable to the nature of Heresy (which always
defendeth itself by the name and countenance of
other matter more plausible); neither so apt to further his
wicked purpose, being not a case so general to allure all
sorts to take part with him: he determined to speak no
<span class="sidenote">The colour of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
Rebellion.</span> word of Religion, but to make the only colour
[<i>pretence</i>] of his commotion, only to withstand
Strangers [<i>i.e. the Spaniards</i>], and to advance Liberty.</p>

<p>For as he made his full reckoning that such as accorded
with him in religion would wholly join with him in that
rebellion; so he trusted that the Catholics for the most part
would gladly embrace that quarrel against the Strangers;
whose name he took to become odible to all sorts by the
seditious and malicious report which he and his had
maliciously imagined and blown abroad against
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s preparative
to his Rebellion.</span> that nation, as a preparative to
their abominable treason.</p>

<p>His Proclamation therefore published at Maidstone, and
so in other places, persuaded that quarrel to be taken in
hand in the defence of the realm from overrunning by
Strangers and for the advancement of Liberty: where, in
very deed, his only and very matter was the continuance of
heresy: as by his own words at sundry times shall hereafter
appear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
untrue persuasions
to
further his
Rebellion.</div>

<p>And to the end the people should not think that he alone,
with a few other mean Gentlemen, had taken that traitorous
enterprise in hand without comfort or aid of higher
powers, he untruly and maliciously added further
to his Proclamation, by persuasion to the people:</p>

<p>That all the Nobility of the realm and the whole [Privy]
Council (one or two only except) were agreeable to his
pretensed treason, and would with all their power and
strength further the same; (which he found most untrue, to
his subversion): and That the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, [Sir
<span class="smcap">Thomas Cheyney</span>,] the Lord Warden [of the Cinque
Ports], Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Southwell</span>, High Sheriff, with all
other Gentlemen would join with him in this enterprise, and
set their foot by his, to repel the Strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
untrue persuasions
abused the
people.</div>

<p>This Proclamation and such annexed persuasions made at
Maidstone on the market day, and in other parts
of the Shire, had so wrought in the hearts of
the people that divers (which before hated him, and
he them) were now, as it seemed, upon this occasion,
mutually reconciled; and said unto him, "Sir, is your
quarrel only to defend us from overrunning by Strangers
and to advance Liberty; and not against the Queen?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of
a heretic is to
say one thing
and think
another.</div>

<p>"No," quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "we mind nothing less
than any wise to touch her Grace; but to serve
her and honour her, according to our duties."</p>

<p>"Well," quod they, "give us then your hand. We will
stick to you to death in this quarrel!"</p>

<p>That done, there came to him one other, of good wealth,
saying, "Sir," quod he, "they say I love potage well. I will
sell all my spoons, and all the plate in my house rather than
your purpose shall quail; and sup my potage with my
mouth [see p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>]. I trust," quod he, "you will restore the
right religion again."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s own
words to prove
Heresy to be
the ground of
his Rebellion.</div>

<p>"Whist!" quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "you may not so much as name
religion, for that will withdraw from us the hearts
of many. You must only make your quarrel for
overrunning by Strangers. And yet to thee, be it
said in counsel, as unto my friend, we mind <i>only</i>
the restitution of GOD's Word. But no words!"</p>

<p>By these his words it appeared that his principal intent
was not to keep out Strangers, which commonly do not
invade to our hindrance but by rebellion amongst ourselves;
nor to advance Liberty, which ever decayeth through
treason: but to advance Heresy, the Lady Regent of his
life and doings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This same Thursday [25th January 1554] as <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Isley</span>, and others were occupied at Maidstone
with Proclamations to stir the people and such like; so were
others his confederates occupied in like manner by Proclamations
at Milton, Ashford, and other towns in the east
parts of the Shire. Through whose allurements, the multitude
were grown so earnestly affected to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s purpose
that they suffered Master <span class="smcap">Christopher Roper</span>, a man of
good worship and so esteemed of them, to be taken of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s ministers, and
carried out of the market place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
without any manner of rescue: for that he,

<span class="smcap">Christopher Roper</span> by the

Queen, not only withstood the reading of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
traitorous Proclamation at Milton; but also in the same place
proclaimed him and all his, traitors. And being roughly
charged therewith by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and others his gallants,
<span class="sidenote">Master <span class="smcap">Christopher
Roper</span>'s words to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</span>

"This tongue spake it, and doth now avow it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The apprehension
of Master <span class="smcap">Tucke</span> and
Master <span class="smcap">Dorrel</span>.</div>

<p>They suffered Master <span class="smcap">Tucke</span> also, and Master <span class="smcap">Dorrel</span>
of Calehill, being Gentlemen of good worship and
Justices of Peace, to be taken out of their houses
by the rebels; and conveyed, without any manner
of rescue, in the day time, to Rochester, being
twenty miles distant: where they, with Master <span class="smcap">Roper</span>, were
kept as prisoners in great danger of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In like manner, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span>, <span class="smcap">Anthony Knevet</span>,
<span class="smcap">William Knevet</span>, with others, were at Tonbridge, Sevenoaks,
and other towns in the west parts of the Shire, stirring
the people by alarms, drums, and Proclamations.</p>

<p>Now ye shall understand that the evening afore [24th
January 1554] the publishing his pretence at

<span class="sidenote">How <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
wrote to the Sheriff of his intent to stir.</span>

Southwell</span>, being Sheriff of the Shire: unto whom long
before, as I can understand, he had neither spoken nor
written other than in defiance; they being in contention for
matters of religion as it was said. Nevertheless to serve his
purpose, dissembling his great malice and haughty courage,
he wrote a letter to him of such effect as followeth:</p>

<p>The messenger that brought the letter, with the Proclamation,
from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> to the Sheriff, being not privy to the contents
thereof and having charge, upon his life, to return an
answer with all speed, importuned the Sheriff so much therefore
(although he saw him greatly busied in giving advertisement
throughout the Shire of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s traitorous determination)
as he nevertheless (to satisfy the messenger, whom he
knew to be a right honest man; notwithstanding his diligence
was abused in so lewd a message), made him answer out of
hand as followeth:</p>

in this case I disdain to answer, or to speak with
you apart coming from a traitor, you may say
unto him, That as indeed I have been desirous of
his friendship for neighbourhood's sake, so have I much more
desired his reformation in divers points of great disorder:
whereby he certainly knew, as well by my speech to himself
as other means coming to his knowledge, that I have sithens
the beginning of the Queen's reign holden him and some of
his colleges [<i>colleagues</i>] in this conspiracy vehemently suspected
for like matters as now they have attempted.</span></p>

<p>"Wherein seeing he hath not deceived me, but by opening
himself hath manifestly verified mine opinion conceived of
him; I purpose not to purchase his friendship so dear[ly] as
for the game of him to lose myself and my posterity in
perpetual infamy. And if such things which his fond [<i>foolish</i>]
head hath weighed for perils, to the condemnation of the
whole wisdom of the realm (they allowing the same for good),
had been indeed as perilous as he with others, for want of
due consideration, deemeth them: his duty had been to have
opened his opinion therein as a humble and reverent
petitioner to the Queen's Highness, or to some of her Grace's
Council. But to press his Sovereign, in any suit or upon
any occasion, with weapon and armour, by stirring her
subjects to rebellion; that is, and always hath been, accounted
the part of the most arrogant and presumptuous traitors:
and so do I note him and his mates, as you may tell them;
and shall, GOD willing, provide for them accordingly.</p>

<p>"Now good man <span class="smcap">Monde</span>, it shall be in your choice
whether you will carry this message or no. But, as your
friend, I shall advise you to seek out better company."</p>

<p>The messenger excusing himself by ignorance, departed to
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> with answer: and, soon after, returned to the Sheriff;
under whom he served the Queen very faithfully.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Sheriff being made privy, as ye have heard, by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
to his traitorous pretence the night before he stirred; and
wanting no good will, as it should seem, with the help of the
Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> who was as forward as he, to have
resisted the reading of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s Proclamation at Maidstone
the day following and to disperse his force, sent for Gentlemen
and yeomen in all haste to that end.</p>

<p>But before he could gather Power meet to attempt the
repressing of such a force (sundry of his neighbours of
greatest possessions, and towns most populous, which should
have been his chief aid, being contrary bent), <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> accompanied
with a force well armed and weaponed marched to
Rochester the same Thursday [25th January 1554]; <span class="smcap">Harper</span>
and others meeting him in the way. Where fortifying the
east parts of the town, and breaking up the bridge towards
the west; he abode the coming of his appointed strength:
suffering all passengers to pass quietly through the town, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
London, or to the sea; taking nothing from them but only
their weapons.</p>

<p>And being the Friday [26th January] all day at Rochester,
and not hearing from <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, the town of Tonbridge, and
other his conjurates of the west part of the Shire; he
addressed an earnest letter the Saturday morning [27th
January] to <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, the <span class="smcap">Knevets</span>, and others, with the town of
Tonbridge, requiring them to accelerate their coming unto him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rifling of
Sir <span class="smcap">Henry
Sidney</span> his

<p>According whereunto <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, the <span class="smcap">Knevets</span>, with others,
being newly returned from Penshurst (where they rifled Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry Sidney</span> [of] his armour; he being
attendant upon the Queen's Highness as a faithful
subject), perceiving <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> to long for their coming,
resolved to observe their promise and march forwards
that night towards <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<p>But understanding that the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the
Sheriff, and <span class="smcap">George Clarke</span> had now gathered a force, and
were prest to encounter them: first ere they departed out of
the town, they thought it good by some kind of Proclamation,
to alienate the people's hearts from them; as they did in the
manner following:</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<h4><i>The copy of the Proclamation made at Tonbridge,<br />
by Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span>, <span class="smcap">Antony Knevet</span><br />
and his brother, with others.</i></h4>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_small_y.png" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.3em;"><span class="smcap">YOu</span> shall understand that <span class="smcap">Henry</span> [<span class="smcap">Neville</span>]
Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, <span class="smcap">Robert Southwell</span>
Knight, <span class="smcap">George Clarke</span> Gentleman, have most
traitorously, to the disturbance of the common
wealth, stirred and raised up the Queen's most
loving subjects of this realm to defend the most wicked and
devilish enterprise of certain of the wicked and perverse
Councillors, to the utter confusion of this her Grace's realm,
and the perpetual servitude of all the Queen's most loving
subjects. In consideration whereof, we Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Wyat</span>
Knight, Sir <span class="smcap">George Harper</span> Knight, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span>
Knight, <span class="smcap">Antony Knevet</span> Esquire, with all the faithful
Gentlemen of Kent and trusty commons of the same, do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
pronounce the said <span class="smcap">Henry</span> Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, <span class="smcap">Robert
Southwell</span> and <span class="smcap">George Clarke</span> Gentleman, to be traitors
to GOD, the Crown, and the common wealth.</span></p>

<p>This done, with all speed calling their company together
by noise of drums, and leaving their direct way to Rochester,
for that they would not come under the wing of the Lord
<span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff, they marched that night
[27th January] to Sevenoaks. Taking order with such as
were left behind in the town [of Tonbridge], that they should
be in a readiness to come whensoever they should be sent
for by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>; and that by no ways they should believe any
tales. "For," quod they, "the Council will now send abroad
flying lies and tales to discredit us and discomfort you: for
it is their policy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antony Knevet</span>, after he was lept to his horse, took one
by the hand, and said, "Fare you well. And if you hap to
hear that I am taken, never believe it: for undoubtedly I
will either die in the field or achieve my purpose." But
within four and twenty hours he brake his promise, and ran
away no faster than his legs could carry him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The Herald's
coming to
Rochester.</div>

<p>Well, I shall now leave them marching to Sevenoaks; and
return to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> at Rochester. This present
Saturday [27th January] came unto him from the
Queen's Highness a Herald and a trumpeter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, at the sound of the trumpet, came to the bridge,
where the Herald was with his coat armour carrying
the Arms of England on his back. But <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, without
using any reverence to him either for his coat or office,
would not suffer him to come into the town to declare his
message; and [the Herald] pressing to come in, he offered to
strike him: whereupon the Herald stayed and did his message
there, so that only <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> with a few with him heard it.
Which, as men could gather by the report of them that heard
it, was promise of pardon to as many as would retire to their
houses within four and twenty hours after the Proclamation,
and become good subjects. But <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> would not suffer his
soldiers in anywise to hear it, nor any other Proclamation
coming from the Queen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord
Warden's
greeting to
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</div>

<p>In the mean time also, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Cheyney</span>, Lord
Warden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
being a most faithful and noble subject, had sent
him such salutations as of honour ought to be used
to a traitor. And being very desirous to be doing
with him, and to prove on his body what in
words of greeting he had affirmed, felt yet by his discretion
and long experience great causes of stay.  For <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
desired nothing more than his coming forth; persuading
[himself] that he wanted no friends about him, nor any
others that would take in hand to repress him with force
gathered in that Shire.  And, undoubtedly, doubtful were
the hearts of the people, and marvellously bent to favour
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his purpose; as by daily events appeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff who, the
Saturday [27th January] next after <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s stir, were at
Malling in the way towards Rochester (where <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> lay);
having with them a company of well appointed subjects.
In whom notwithstanding for the more part they had good
opinion of trustiness and honesty: yet having the general
case of the people's disposition in their eye; and not without
cause suspecting in their Band, amongst so many faithful
and good, some such to be, upon trust of whose trustless
and brittle aid it were no good policy to adventure far&mdash;pondering
therewith that this illusion of the people, whereby
they were so far drawn from their right course and duty,
grew chiefly by such crafty and false persuasions as <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
and his mates had set forth in sundry parts of the Shire,
by way of Proclamation in writing: wherein, amongst other
gross lies they had set forth also matters of untruth to
discredit the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff; as
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, in his persuasions, that they would join with him;
and <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, in his Proclamation that they had traitorously
assembled the Queen's loving subjects against her Grace
and the realm.</p>

<p>It seemed unto them very good and necessary to spend
some time at Malling in advising and lessening [<i>lessoning</i>]
the multitude; and by way of exhortation to impugn those
traitorous Proclamations, and refell such gross and false
lies therein contained; and finally to dissuade the people,
which, that day being market day, were assembled to a great
number of all sorts, from the traitors and their attempts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>And accordingly the Sheriff had penned an Exhortation
to that purpose, which was pronounced out of writing in
Malling; and sent after by him into other parts. The
hearing whereof did undoubtedly much move the people,
as after shall appear.</p>

<p>I shall report the same in substance truly; howbeit not
fully in the same form and manner as I found it, and as
it was penned and pronounced by the Sheriff: who, in
the utterance and setting forth thereof, spared not to speak
plainly and touch sharply, as then the present time and
case employed vehement occasion.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">LOving</span> neighbours and friends. Where of late
there hath been most pestilent and traitorous
Proclamations, as ye have heard, set forth by
<span class="smcap">Thomas Wyat</span>, <span class="smcap">George Harper</span>, <span class="smcap">Henry

accounting themselves to be the best of the Shire in their
Proclamations; and in the same reputing and pronouncing
others as traitors whom ye can witness to have been, from
time to time, true and faithful subjects to the Queen and
this our common weal, as the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
present, myself, and other Gentlemen now prest and
ready with you, according to our duty, to serve our noble
Queen. I shall need to spend the less time to declare
unto you how evil they be, or how evil their enterprise
is that they have taken in hand: forasmuch as this their
arrogant presumption and presumptuous pride in advancing
themselves so far from all truth, and in depraving of others
so maliciously for executing their bounden duty, ought
abundantly to persuade what they be, to all of consideration,
without further circumstance.</p>

<p>"But forasmuch as in their Proclamations they fill the
ears of the Queen's liege people with gross and manifest
lies to stir them against her Grace, in the utterance whereof
they use this demonstration, "Lo!" signifying some notable
thing near at hand, for credit worthy impression in their
memory, as:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Lo, a great number of Strangers be now arrived
at Dover in harness [<i>armour</i>] with harquebusses
morians and matchlight.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"I say unto you, neighbours and friends, upon pain to
be torn in pieces with your hands, that it is untrue; and
a manifest lie invented by them to provoke and irritate
the Queen's simple people to join with them in their traitorous
enterprise. And therefore I have perfect hope that you,
being afore time abused with their crafty and deceitful
treason, will not now once again (having experience of
their former evil) be trapped, for any persuasion, in so
heinous a snare as this most vile and horrible crime of
treason.</p>

<p>"Do you not see and note that, as in the beginning
of the Queen's most gracious reign, some of them sought
to deprive her Grace of her princely estate and rightful
dignity, minding to advance thereunto the Lady <span class="smcap">Jane</span>,
daughter to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>; so are they and others
newly confedered [<i>confederated</i>] with the Duke and his
brethren, being in arms at this present for the same purpose,
and daily looking for aid of these traitors and others of
their conspiracy: as by the Queen's most gracious letters,
signed with her own hand, and ready to be read here, may
plainly appear unto you? And will you now nevertheless
aid them any ways, or sit still whilst they go about thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
wrongfully and traitorously to depose their, and our, most
gracious Sovereign Lady and Queen! the comfort of us
all! the stay of us all! the only safeguard of us all! to
whom can no displeasure or danger chance, but the same
must double [<i>doubly</i>] redound to all and every of us!</p>

<p>"No, friends and neighbours, I trust never to live to
see you so far abused. They go about to blear you with
matters of Strangers, as though they should come to overrun
you and us also. He seemeth very blind, and willingly
blinded, that will have his sight dimmed with such a fond
[<i>foolish</i>] mist! For if they meant to resist Strangers, as
they mind nothing less: they would then prepare to go to
the sea coasts; and not to the Queen's most royal person,
with such a company in arms and weapon[s].</p>

<p>"Ye can consider, I trust, this noble Gentleman, the Lord
<span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> here present, being of an ancient and great
parentage, born among you; and such other Gentlemen
as you see here, which be no strangers unto you; myself
also, although a poor Gentleman (who I trust at no time
hath abused you), hath somewhat to lose as well as they;
and would be as loth to be overrun with Strangers as
they; if any such thing were meant. But for that we
know most certainly that there is meant no manner of evil
to us by those Strangers; but rather aid profit and comfort
against other strangers, our ancient enemies [<i>the French</i>];
with whom they, as most arrant and degenerate traitors,
do indeed unkindly and unnaturally join: we, in her Grace's
defence, will spend both life and what we have beside, to
the uttermost penny, against them.</p>

<p>"Well, I can no more now say unto you, but (understanding
the Queen's Highness, as a most merciful Princess,
to be once again determined to pardon as many as, by
their traitorous and deceitful Proclamations and other
illusions, were allured to this last treason; so they repair
to their habitations within four and twenty hours after
her Grace's Proclamation read, and become true subjects
to her Grace) to advise such as hath taken part with those
traitors, or have withdrawn themselves (contrary to their
allegiance) from aiding and serving of their Sovereign,
according to their duties, against her enemies, thankfully
to accept and embrace her most gracious pardon; and use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
means of themselves to apprehend those arrant and principal
traitors, and make a present of them to the Queen's
Highness; or leave them to themselves, as most detestable
traitors: who being once so graciously and mercifully
forgiven could not but carry the clemency of the same in
their hearts to the furtherance of all obedience whiles they
lived, if there had been any spark of grace in them.</p>

<p>"And further I have to say unto you that as these
traitors, by their Proclamations without authority, have
moved you to stir against the Queen your Sovereign; and
appointed you places where to meet and consult for the
furtherance of their traitorous purpose and to bring with
you such aid as you can: so shall I require you, and in
her Grace's name charge you that be here present, not
to come there; but that you, and such as be absent, taking
knowledge hereby, repair to such places as I, the Queen's
Sheriff and Officer, shall appoint you, with such aid as
you can bring for the better service of the Queen and the
Shire: where you shall be assured to receive comfort,
thanks, and honesty to the end of your lives and your
posterity. And the other way but endless shame and
utter undoing to you and yours; which shall be worst to
yourselves, and yet a great grief to us your neighbours:
whose advice in all other your private causes you have
been content to follow; and now in this weightiest that
hath, or may, happen to you will refuse us, and follow
them that hath ever abused you to your and their utter
confusion.</p>

<p>The Sheriff reading this Exhortation, caused one <span class="smcap">Barram</span>,
a Gentleman and servant to the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, to
pronounce it, as he read it, so loud and so distinctly as
the people assembled round about him, to a very great

and all the Gentlemen here present: in
whose persons I then spake; and now require at your hands

else with the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and such Gentlemen
as you see here present, that will live and die with you
in defence of our rightful Queen against these traitors?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The people's

<p>The people with one voice defied <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his complices
as arrant traitors, and said that they now well
espied they had but abused them. Wherefore in
defence of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, they would die upon
them: expressing their minds with such earnest shouts and
cries as shewed to proceed unfeignedly from their hearts;
which after was confirmed by a better experience the day

crow a higher note in another place." What trow you

<div class="sidenote">The Lord
<span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>
sets the watch
in person.</div>

<p>This Saturday [27th January] at night, the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>
suspecting <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his complices (living within
four miles of them; and being so much provoked in that
they were, in the day, so rightly set forth in their colours
[<i>illusions</i>] at Malling) would, for revenge, work some
annoyance to them or his Band that night, either by a
<i>camasado</i> [<i>night attack</i>] or by some other means; did
therefore, to prevent the same, set a strong watch in the
market place at Malling and other parts of entry
into the town: and gave the watch-word himself
before he would take any rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A larom at
Malling.</div>

<p>But between one and two of the clock in the night, when
everybody was taken to rest save the watch, there
happened a larom [<i>an alarm</i>], sundry crying,
"Treason! Treason! We are all betrayed!" in such sort
that such as were in their beds or newly risen thought
verily that, either <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> with his Band had been in the
town, or very near.</p>

<p>The thing was so sudden and happened in such a time as
men not acquainted with like matters were so amazed
that some of them knew not well what to do: and yet
in the end it proved to [be] nothing.</p>

<p>For it grew by a messenger that came, very late in the
night, desiring to speak with the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> or
Master Sheriff, to give them certain advertisement, That
Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span>, the two <span class="smcap">Knevets</span>, and certain others,
with 500 Wealdish men [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>from the Weald of Kent</i>] were
at Sevenoaks; and would march in the morning early from

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whereupon the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff,
by the advice of the Gentlemen before named, for that
the said <span class="smcap">Clarke</span> had been a painful [<i>painstaking</i>] and
serviceable Gentleman, changed their purposed journey from
Rochester, to encounter with <span class="smcap">Isley</span> and his Band, to cut

<p>And so, in the morning early, being Sunday [28th January
1554], the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>; the Sheriff; <span class="smcap">Warram Sentleger</span>,

<span class="smcap">Walter Heronden</span>, <span class="smcap">Walter Taylor</span>, <span class="smcap">John Raynoldes</span>,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Tuttesham</span>, <span class="smcap">John Allen</span>, and <span class="smcap">Thomas
Holdiche</span>, Gentlemen; with yeomen to the number of
600 or thereabouts; marched out of Malling in order till

<span class="sidenote">Wrotham
Heath.</span>

they came to Wrotham Heath: where they might
easily hear the sound of the traitor's drums; and
so, making haste, pursued them till they came to a place

<span class="sidenote">Barrow Green.</span>

called Barrow Green [<i>Borough Green</i>] through
which lay their right and ready way that the traitors
should take, marching from Sevenoaks towards Master
<span class="smcap">Clarke</span>.</p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, being very glad that he had
prevented [<i>anticipated</i>] them in winning the Green, sent
out spials [<i>spies</i>] to understand their nearness, and to discrive
[<i>ascertain</i>] their number: reposing themselves there
till the return of his spials: who at their coming said, That
he needed not to take further pains to pursue them, for
they were at hand, coming towards him as fast as they could
march. Which was glad tidings to the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>
and his Band. And taking order forthwith to set his men
in array; he determined to abide their coming, and there
to take or give the overthrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The shrinking
of the rebels.</div>

<p>Which the traitors understanding, Whether it was for
that they misliked the match, or the place to fight; whiles
the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and his Band were busy
in placing themselves; they shrank as secretly as
they could by a bye-way. And were so far gone before
the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> understood thereof by his spials;
as for doubt [<i>fear</i>] of overtaking them afore their coming
to Rochester, he was driven to make such haste for the
overtaking of them as divers of his footmen were far behind
at the onset giving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rebel's
overtaken.</div>

<p>The first sight that the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> could have
of them, after they forsook their purposed way, was as they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

ascended Wrotham Hill, directly over [against] Yaldarn,
Master <span class="smcap">Peckham</span>'s house. Where they, thinking to have

<span class="sidenote">The displaying
of the rebel's
Ensigns.</span>

great advantage by the winning of the Hill, displayed
their Ensigns bravely: seeming to be in
great ruff.  But it was not long after ere their courage
was abated.  For the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the Sheriff,
and the rest of the Gentlemen, with such other of the
Queen's true and faithful subjects, as with great pains
taking to climb the Hill and to hold way with
the Horsemen, overtook the rebels at a field

<span class="sidenote">Blacksoll Field.</span>

called Blacksoll Field in the parish of Wrotham,
a mile distant from the very top of the Hill; where the
Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the Sheriff, the Gentlemen aforenamed,
and others the Queen's true and faithful subjects,

<span class="sidenote">The Skirmish.</span>

handled them so hot and so fiercely that, after a
small shot with long bows by the traitors, and a fierce
brag shewed by some of the Horsemen, they took their
flight away as fast as they could. Yet of them were taken
prisoners above three score.</p>

<p>In this conflict <span class="smcap">Warram Sentleger</span>, who brought with
him a good company of soldiers and [was] always a serviceable
Gentleman, also <span class="smcap">George Clarke</span>, <span class="smcap">Antony
Weldon</span>, and <span class="smcap">Richard Clarke</span> did very honestly
behave themselves. <span class="smcap">William Sentleger</span>, hearing of
a fray towards between the Queen's true subjects and the
traitors, came to the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> into the field,
with all haste, not an hour before the Skirmish; who with
the rest of the Gentlemen, with certain of the Lord
<span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>'s and [the] Sheriff's servants, being all

<span class="sidenote">The chase of
the Horsemen.</span>

well horsed, served faithfully: and from thence chased
the Horsemen till they came to a wood called
Hartley Wood, four miles distant from the place
where the onset began.</p>

<p>The Queen's true subjects did so much abhor their
treason, and had the traitors in such detestation, as with
great difficulty any escaped with life that were taken
prisoners; and yet were they all very well armed and
weaponed, and had also great advantage by the place of
fight. Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span> lay all that night in the Wood,
and fled after into Hampshire. The two <span class="smcap">Knevets</span>, being
well horsed, were so hastily pursued as they were driven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to leave their horses, and creep into the Wood;
and for haste to rip their boots from their legs and
run away in the vampage of their hose. The chase
continued so long as night came on before it was full
finished.</p>

<p>Thus were <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, the <span class="smcap">Knevets</span>, and their Band overthrown
by the faithful service of divers Gentlemen and
yeomen serving under the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the
Sheriff; whose forwardness courage and wisdom in this
traitorous broil no doubt was very much praiseworthy; as
well for their speedy acceleration of their strength which
(considering how they were every way [en]compassed with
the traitors) was no small matter in so little space; and for
their wise and politic handling also in keeping them
together from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, who marvellously and by sundry
ways sought to allure them away. For had not they, in
their own persons, to the encouraging of their company
adventured far; and by their wisdom, discretion and great
charge, politically handled the matter: some think that
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> had been at London before he was looked for by
any good man, with no small train; whose journey was
greatly hindered, and his company very much discomfited
by this repulse given to <span class="smcap">Isley</span> and his Band. Where,
amongst other things, GOD's secret hand was greatly felt,
to the great comfort and present aid of true subjects against
the traitors: who having such advantage of the place, as
indeed they had, were like rather to give, than receive,
so foul an overthrow. But this it is, you see, to serve in a
true cause; and her whom GOD so favoureth that he
will not suffer the malice and rage of her enemies at any
time to prevail against her: to whom he hath given so
many notable victories and so miraculous that her enemies
might seem rather to have been overthrown <i>Spiritu DEI</i>
than vanquished <i>humano robore</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thanksgiving
to GOD for
victory.</div>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the Sheriff, and the Gentlemen
with them, after they had given humble
thanks to GOD for the victory, which they did
very reverently in the Field, and taken order for the prisoners,
were driven to divide themselves for want of harborough
[<i>lodging</i>] and vittaile [<i>victuals</i>] for the soldiers, that had
well deserved both. The Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
with him went to Wrotham. The Sheriff and certain with
him to Otford, where they had much to do to get vittaile
for their soldiers.</p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff (suspecting
that some of those Gentlemen lately discomfited in this
Skirmish would not long tarry in the realm, but make
shift to pass the seas; yea, by spial [<i>spies</i>], understanding
that <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> himself with some of his company thereunto
bent) devised to lay [<i>warn</i>] the country [round] about, that
they might not escape. And considering that they would
not do it at Dover, nor in that coast [<i>district</i>]; they
knowing [Sir <span class="smcap">John Cheyney</span>] the Lord Warden to have

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Thomas Dorrell</span> of
Scotney the younger.</span>

such watch unto them: but rather, for sundry respects,
at Rye, or more southward. And having great
proof of <span class="smcap">Thomas Dorrell</span> the younger his
fidelity; he returned the same <span class="smcap">Dorrell</span>, being
newly come unto him with 80 men well appointed, into
Sussex: giving him strait charge that, consulting with Sir
<span class="smcap">John Guildford</span>, they should, both day and night, set
a sure watch for the passing of any that way to the seacoast;
and further to take such order as no munition, fish,
wine, or other vittaile coming out of these parts, should pass
to the relief of the traitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antony Knevet</span>, notwithstanding great and strait watch
laid round about the country by the Sheriff for the apprehension
of him and others that fled, arrived that Sunday
[28th January 1554] at night late at Rochester: where

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Harper</span>'s
running away from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</span>

his news was so joyful that <span class="smcap">Harper</span> forthwith
found the mean[s] to rid himself out of their
company, without any leave taking; and ran to the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>. To whom he seemed so greatly to lament
his treason, that the Duke, pitying his case, the rather for
the long acquaintance between them in times past, received
him to grace. But, within a day after, he ran from the
Duke and returned to his old mate; as hereafter shall
appear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> hearing of <span class="smcap">Isley</span>
his overthrow, and understanding
by the proceeding at Malling the day before, that
those things set forth in his Proclamations whereby he
thought his strength at home to be most surely knit unto
him, were now become rather a weakening than otherwise;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the people there being ready to fall from him for his so
abusing of them: he fell into so great extreme anguish and
sorrow, as writing a letter of expostulation to some of his

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> bewailing
his case with tears.</span>

familiars abroad, in reprehension of their infidelity in that
they sticked not to him so fast as they promised,
he bedewed the paper whereupon he wrote with
tears issuing so abundantly from his eyes as it would bear

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s coat of
fence quilted with angels.</span>

no ink. And so leaving to write, calling for a
privy coat [of armour] that he had quilted with
angels [<i>a gold coin of the value of 10s.</i>] not long afore;
which might serve both for his defence, and [also be] a
refuge for his necessity being in another country: he

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s practice
to fly by sea.</span>

practised with such as were near unto him, where
they might have ready passage, and most for
their surety to take the sea. "For England," said he, "is
no place for us to rest in."</p>

<p>His company also shrank from him as fast as they could
devise means to escape: whereunto <span class="smcap">Thomas Isley</span> and
others had a greater respect than himself; he seeming to
take care for nothing but how he might safely convey
himself [away]; being well friended, it was thought, with
some of the ship-masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> mated.</div>

<p>Thus was <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> so mated by the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>,
the Sheriff, and their Band as he was at his
wits' end, as ye have heard: and chiefly by keeping him
from that, which by spial about him they afterwards understood
him specially to desire; which was offer of battle.
He and his being fully persuaded that there could be no
great force raised against him in the Shire; whereof the
most part should not be his when it should come to the
shew. Wherein although he might be deceived, as indeed
he was; yet his quarrel, with the disposition of the
people thereunto well considered, with the end of his
travail which could be but spoil and ravin (ready means
and lures to draw the careless multitude unto him): it
seemed to the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and such as served
with him, better policy for to weary <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, and weaken
him by the cutting away of his strength from him; than to
offer him battle till the Duke of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>'s coming: whom
the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff knew to be at
hand towards <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>; unto whom they and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Gentlemen of their Band, after their Skirmish with <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, made
the haste possible they might.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But before their coming, the case was wonderfully
changed, to the great discomfort of all the Queen's true
subjects: and that came to pass that [<i>which</i>] of all men
was least feared. For who was it that suspected such
cruel and malicious disposition to remain in any English
heart towards his country, in any subject's thought towards
his Sovereign, that, receiving her Grace's armour weapons
and money, would have played so traitorous a part as
these Captains did with their Band? It is so strange a
case as the world never saw. It is so malicious a part as
the Jew would not have done the like, having received his
hire to serve.</p>

<p>So it was that the noble Duke, being an ancient and
worthy Captain (and yet, by long imprisonment, so diswonted
from the knowlege of our malicious World and the
iniquity of our Time, as he suspecting nothing less than
that which followed; but judging every man to accord

<span class="sidenote">The Duke's

with him in desire to serve truly, marched forth the
Monday [29th January 1554], about ten of the
clock in the morning, from Gravesend to Stroud
towards Rochester; and about four of the clock
in the afternoon of the same day, he arrived at Stroud, near

<span class="sidenote">The names of
the Gentlemen

unto Rochester: having with him the Captain of

Knights; <span class="smcap">John Coverte</span>, <span class="smcap">Roger Appulton</span>, Esquires;
and <span class="smcap">Thomas Swan</span>, Gentleman: with certain of the Guard,
and others, to the number of 200 or thereabout.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bret</span>, Chief
Captain of the
White Coats.</div>

<p>Besides <span class="smcap">Bret</span> and other five Captains: who, with their
Band, being 600, all in white coats, tarried behind
at a hill called Spittle [<i>Hospital</i>] Hill, near unto
Stroud; whiles the Duke went to Stroud to see
the planting of the ordnance. Which being ready charged
and bent upon the town of Rochester; and perceiving
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and the other traitors, by hanging out their flags
upon the bridge wall, to be in great bravery; which
considering the miserable state they were in the night
before, could not be, had they not received some new comfort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
by some traitorous mean[s]: the Duke commanded one of
the pieces to be fired for shot into Rochester.</p>

<p>And, as the gunner was firing the piece, Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Bray</span>'s eldest son came in all haste to the Duke saying,
"Sir, did I not tell your Grace, this morning, that yonder
false wretches would deceive you?"</p>

<p>"How know you that?" quod the Duke.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," quod <span class="smcap">Braye</span>, "you may see them, as false
traitors [ready] bent against you."</p>

<p>And immediately <span class="smcap">Bret</span> and other Captains of the White
Coats with their Band, being upon the Hill and at the
back of the Duke, made great and loud shouts sundry

<span class="sidenote">The revolt of the Captains of the White
Coats and their Band.</span>

times, crying "We are all Englishmen! We are
all Englishmen!": fashioning themselves in array,
ready bent with their weapons to set upon the
Duke, if he had made any resistance.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Duke and the Captain of the Guard
commanded the pieces that were bent upon the town, to
be turned upon <span class="smcap">Bret</span> and his Band. But, upon further
consideration, the shot was spared: and the Duke's Grace
with the Captain of the Guard Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Jerningham</span>,
considering (not without bleeding hearts) their chief strength
thus turned upon them, so that they were now environed
both behind and before with traitorous enemies, shifted
themselves away; as did also their company.</p>

<p>After whose departure, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, accompanied with two
or three and not many more, came out of Rochester half
a mile from the town at the least, to meet the six Captains

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Harper</span>
returned to
his old mate.</span>

of the White Coats. Amongst whom was <span class="smcap">Harper</span>, notwithstanding
his crouching and kneeling before
the Duke; and fair promises that he would undertake
that <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> should have yielded. Who,
footing afore the other Captains, with his sword drawn,
said to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "I promised you good turn, and say
not now but I have paid it."</p>

<p>Who had seen the embracing, clipping, and congratulation
used at this meeting from traitor to traitor, might justly
wonder thereat. Shortly after they had well clawed one
another, they went together like themselves into Rochester.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When this, of all other most infortunate chance[s], came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the knowledge of the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the Sheriff,
and their friends; they were not a little troubled with the
strangeness of the case: much doubting that the people,
which before seemed brought to good frame, would be
impaired by this alteration; and such as were afore evil
disposed would not be greatly amended thereby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sheriff's
being at
Maidstone.</div>

<p>The Sheriff, being the same night at Maidstone, that had
come the same day from Otford, fourteen miles
distant, to meet <span class="smcap">Thomas Guildford</span>, <span class="smcap">Steven
Dorrell</span>, <span class="smcap">Edward Horden</span>, <span class="smcap">John Robartes</span>,
and <span class="smcap">John Finch</span>, Esquires, to march towards the Duke.
And in the morning, so far from any mistrust of that which
followed the same day [Monday, 29th January 1554], as
having no sure place to convey the prisoners, taken the
day before in the Skirmish with <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, he left the chiefest
and trustiest of his servants and friends, both Gentlemen
and yeomen, of all his Band at Malling, for the
safeguard of the prisoners; where also lay the Lord
<span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and his Band: doubting [<i>fearing</i>] that
<span class="smcap">Isley</span> and the rest that escaped would have made some means
that night to have recovered the prisoners; sundry of whom,
being men of good wealth and well friended, and [at that
moment] living within four miles of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<p>Upon these news, whether it were for the absence [from
Maidstone] of the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and his
strength, or mistrusting false measure in the town

<span class="sidenote">The Sheriff's
secret return
to Malling.</span>

[of Maidstone], or moved with example of the
revolt of the White Coats: he thought, it should seem,
Maidstone no meet place for him to make any abode;
nor yet good policy, all parts considered, to disclose the
time of his removing. But judging plainly himself the
only mark of these parts whereat the traitors shot; or falling
any ways into their hands, so newly after the case of the
Duke, one part of the tragedy to be then ended: he returned
to his strength; giving knowledge to the Gentlemen remaining
in Maidstone to repair to his house for consultation,
What was to be done for the redubbing of that unhappy chance?</p>

<p>In which consultation there did rise so many different
opinions; some saying, They would to the Queen; and
some, to the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> being her Grace's
Lieutenant: that the Sheriff, without further debating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
intreating the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and certain Gentlemen
to remain and entertain such of their Bands as they could

delay, [and then] went to the [Privy] Council for knowledge

<p>The traitors and their friends were grown as men revived
from death to life, flattering themselves that a thing so
far above men's expectation could not have happened to
them so fortunately but by GOD's miraculous provision, as
favouring greatly their case: and so it blew abroad, as well
by wind as by writing; the more part of the people being
ready to believe it, as the case, in the heads of the multitude,
was wonderfully changed both for strength and opinion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
advertisement
to the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> advertised by his letter the Duke of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>
of his victory "by GOD's provision" as he termed
it: whose letter was intercepted in Essex, as
the messenger passed the ferry, by a servant
of Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Southwell</span>'s; and brought to the Council.</p>

<p>He wrote also to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>, but in another
style; his letters being open and importing such matter as
follloweth:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s letter
to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Be it known to all men, and especially to the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>, that I have taken nothing in hand
but what I will maintain with the expense of my
life; which, before it depart out of my body, shall be
sold full dear, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such of those parts as hung in the wind, as Neuters,
(whereof were no small number that had lurked in caves

<span class="sidenote">
An Invective
against the
Neuters.</span>

all the tempest, watching but where should come
the victory, that for example of the evil were
nothing inferior to the arrantest traitors but
rather for a number of respects much worse), began to appear
very cheerful, giving themselves great thanks for handling
the matter so finely, that conveying themselves out of the
way by their policy could avoid charge and peril so wittily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
And as they met with such as had served faithfully, with
whom they durst be frank, they spared not to open their
mouths largely, pouring out such language as could be but
lamentable, or rather odible, to every true ear, to understand
any subject so far perverted from his allegiance and duty
that, for gain or security of their own persons, would rejoice
in sitting still as indifferent where the Crown is a party;
or to persuade security to themselves, be they never in so
strong a hold, where their Sovereign is in peril. Which, all
things rightly weighed, seemed a strange persuasion to
account either gain or saving in sparing some part of the
accidents by sitting still to adventure the loss of the
principal whereupon life and the whole dependeth; or by
affecting a little corruption inordinately, to lose both honest
fame and good opinion of his country [<i>County</i>]; which every
honest man ought to seek to preserve as tenderly as the well-doing
of himself and his whole posterity.</p>

<p>Thus may we evidently see the divers effects of divers
inclinations according to truth and untruth of perfect
obedience prevailing in men's hearts. These Neuters, or
counterfeits (that would be neither open foes nor adventurous
friends; but as wily vultures, hovering in the wind to
catch and gripe some part of the prey, although they would
no part of the fray) persuaded themselves to save that which
in their opinion the true hearty subject should lose by giving
such adventure; that was security of body and goods.
Which grant they saved; yet, in the just judgment of the
honest, they deserved thereby the same blot of infamy that
is due to the open enemies.</p>

<p>On the other side, the true and faithful, whose hearts and
hands such dim colour [<i>illusion</i>] of unthankful policy could
not withhold from the utterance of needful service in such
general case of danger, thought it rather a gain to adventure
body and goods; whereby either to preserve the head and
the whole, which was cruelly pursued; or at least by defence
of the same to purchase unto them and their names the
honest opinion of unspotted members, and the immortality
of good fame wherewith truth always rewardeth unfeigned
service. For such an incomparable virtue is faithful loyalty,
so much abhorring all corruptible allurements, that whose
hearts she hath in governance; with such, neither savour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
gain nor hope of security, neither persuasion of friendship ne
other enticement, can so much prevail as, for any respect, they
will digress from the right course of true service. Where
the contrary, wanting that perfection (to taste of Fortune's
corruptible members, whereafter they gape; to obtain quiet
to the restive carcase, and lucre to themselves, the thing they
only seek), are easily drawn to run a clean contrary race.</p>

<p>The naughty [<i>worthless</i>] brood therefore of Counterfeits, of
all others not tolerable in a common weal, are specially to be
looked to in their beginning; lest their evil example by long
sufferance grow to such a precedent at the last, that the
common saying "Good to sleep in a whole skin," being
espied to escape without danger of reprehension, be taken
for a policy; and thereby outweigh the just peize [<i>weight</i>] of
bounden duty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A consultation
of the rebels
after the revolt
of the White
Coats.</div>

<p>After this most unhappy chance, the traitors with their
new adjuncts fell to a great and solemn council
that same night at Rochester for their proceeding
in their pretensed [<i>intended</i>] treason. In discourse
whereof proceeded such unfitting talk, as well
towards the Queen's Highness as her honourable Council,
tending to the alteration of the whole State, as abhorred the
ears of some of the self traitors; that, understanding by
that talk the end of their purpose, whereof before they were
ignorant, wished themselves under the earth for being so
unhappy as to be so much as acquainted with so damnable
an enterprise. Such an opinion had they, as they deemed
very few Councillors, or Officers of authority or of Nobility,
within the realm worthy the places whereunto they were
called: and persuading great choice to be amongst themselves
for the supplying of that want, such overweening had
they of themselves and made so sure a reckoning of the
victory, as they disposed the honourable Offices of the Realm
among themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> thought himself now so sure of the victory as
seeing him that offered "to sell his spoons and all the plate
that he had rather than his purpose should quail, and sup his
pottage with his mouth" [<i>p.</i><a href="#Page_48">48</a>], warranted him, That he
should eat his pottage with silver, as he did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
England, when good counsel should stand it in most
available steed, needed no better counsellors than such as
they were, if they had half the wit they thought themselves
to have, coupled with grace and honesty. But what they
had indeed, their acts declare plainly to their own confusion;
as it hath always, and ever hereafter shall, to as many as be
of like disposition.</p>

<p>One of them, that had some wit indeed, although he
wanted grace, perceiving by their talk in what fond [<i>foolish</i>]
frenzy they were entered; to interrupt them therein, he said,
That such matters were good to be treated of at further
opportunity: but for the present it were meet to devise upon
their next journey [<i>expedition</i>]; and whether it should be
good policy in them, minding to march towards London, to
leave the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff at liberty
(that annoyed their friends, and by all likelihood would not
so cease as they may or dare) at their back, being left at
large.</p>

<p>One of them, taking upon him first to answer, thought
nothing more necessary than their sequestration: and if his

<span class="sidenote">A device to
apprehend the
Sheriff.</span>

advice might have been heard in the beginning
[of the Rebellion], the Sheriff should have been
in hold, as I have heard, before anything should
have been attempted.</p>

<p>But the Captains to the White Coats (meet counsellors for
such an enterprise!), having the spoil of London in their
eyes, would not dispute that was past: but for the present
they persuaded clean contrary to the former opinion; saying
That their going about the apprehension of the Sheriff

<span class="sidenote">The misreckoning of the rebels
upon London.</span>

should be but a loss of time. "For London," said they,
"longed sore[ly] for their coming; which they
could by no means protract without breeding
great peril and weakness to themselves." And
having London at their commandment, whereof they were
in no manner of doubt, if it were not lost by their sloth;
their revenge to the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the Sheriff, with
others [of] their enemies, would easily follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, savouring full well their disposition, and understanding
their meaning by their arguments, and knowing
also that without his assenting thereto he could not long
have their company, yielded to their counsel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, being out of measure exalted into haughty
courage and pride by the revolt of the White Coats, he
marched the day after, being Tuesday [30th January 1554],
in great pomp and glory, carrying with him six pieces of
ordnance which they had gotten of the Queen's, besides their
own, to Cowling Castle, a hold of the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>'s, four
miles distant from Rochester; and not much out of their
way towards London: where the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The assault of
Cowling
Castle.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> at his coming to Cowling Castle, bent his ordnance
against the gate; and with great and sundry shots
and fire brake and burned up a way through the
gate. The Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> defended his Castle as
stoutly as any man might do, having so few against so great
a number; and so little munition; [he] himself discharging
his gun at such as approached the gate right hardily. And
in that assault two of his own men were slain.</p>

<p>After this assault, and talk with the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
marched to Gravesend; where he reposed that night.</p>

<p>From Gravesend, he and his Band marched, the Wednesday
next after [31st January 1554], to Dartford,
where he reposed that night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The coming of
the Master of
the Horse and
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Cornwallis</span>
to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</div>

<p>Whither came Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Hastings</span>, Master of the
Queen's Horse, and Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Cornwallis</span>
Knights, both of her Grace's honourable Privy
Council, sent from the Queen to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> to understand
the cause of his commotion; and also, as it
was said, finding any repentant submission in him, to promise
pardon, or at the least great hope thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, understanding [of] their coming and taking with
him certain of his Band, went to the west end of the town,
where he had planted his ordnance; and at the [a]lighting
of Master <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Cornwallis</span> from
their horses, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, having a partisan [<i>halberd</i>] in his hand,

<span class="sidenote">Pride.</span>

advanced himself somewhat afore such Gentlemen as were
with him; and, using but little reverence due from
a subject to [Privy] Councillors, traced near them.</p>

<p>To whom, the Master of the Horse spake in substance as
followeth:</p>

<p>"The Queen's Majesty requireth to understand the very
cause wherefore you have thus gathered together in arms her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
liege people, which is the part of a traitor; and yet, in your
Proclamations and persuasions, you call yourself a true subject:
which cannot stand together."</p>

<p>"I am no traitor," quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "and the cause whereof I
have gathered the people is to defend the realm from our
overrunning by Strangers; which follows, this Marriage
taking place."</p>

<p>"Why," quod the Queen's Agents, "there be no Strangers
yet come whom either for power or number ye need to suspect.
But if this be your only quarrel, because, ye mislike
the Marriage: will ye come to communication touching that
case? and the Queen, of her gracious goodness, is content ye
shall be heard."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s arrogant
answer.</div>

<p>To whom <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> shaped such answer as clearly might
declare his malicious intent and traitorous heart
to the Queen's own person and royal estate. "I
yield thereto," quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "but for my surety I will rather
be trusted than trust. And therefore I demand the custody
of the Tower, and [of] her Grace in the Tower; the displacing
of certain Councillors, and placing others in their
rooms as to me shall seem best."</p>

<p>Upon this lewd answer, long and stout conference was
between them: insomuch that the Master of the Horse said
unto him, with a stout courage, "<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, before thou shalt
have that thy traitorous demand granted, thou shalt die and
20,000 with thee!"</p>

<p>Shortly after, the Master of the Horse with Master <span class="smcap">Cornwallis</span>,
finding him an arrant traitor and desperately set to
all mischief, returned to the Queen's Majesty.</p>

<p>The common people being with him, and calling to their
remembrance how <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, in all appearance, made his
whole matter of stir for Strangers, and no ways against the
Queen; and perceiving how unreverently he used himself as
well to the Queen's Herald at Rochester as to the Privy
Council[lors] at Dartford; and considering within themselves
also that he would suffer none of the Queen's Proclamations
to be read among them: their hearts began to
rise against him. And among themselves sundry of them
much murmured, wishing with the loss of all they had they
had never been acquainted with <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> nor his doings; and
indeed sought as many ways as they could to be rid of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A crafty
policy.</div>

<p>Which perceived by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his mates, they devised a
bruit [<i>rumour</i>] to be sounded in his Band, that the
Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the Sheriff did cause to
be hanged as many as they could take, coming from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
Band: wherewith the people, standing in a great maze what
to do, were wonderfully perplexed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Queen understanding by the Master of the Horse and
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Cornwallis</span> the arrogancy of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, and notwithstanding
that she perceived her merciful inclination
rather to provoke him than otherwise: yet seemed she
nothing willing, even then, by violence and force, as she
easily might, to suppress him: but yet a longer time to
suffer and abide, if by delay and mercy her enemy might be
won to reconciliation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The suit of the
Nobles to the
Queen.</div>

<p>The Nobility (which were at that time with her Grace,
perceiving such surmounting mercy rather to
increase than any ways to abate courage and
malice in the insolent and proud heart of the traitors;
and further understanding that the traitors deemed the
contation or forbearing to proceed rather of debility or fear
than of mercy and clemency) counselled with her Grace that,
with her gracious leave and licence, they might set upon him
and his Band before he should pass Blackheath: declaring
that to suffer such an arrogant traitor, being but a mean
member, to approach thus contemptuously so near her royal
person, as it were in defiance of her Grace and her true
subjects, should greatly redound to their dishonours in the
opinion of all faithful men throughout the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen's
answer to the
Nobles.</div>

<p>The Queen gave them all most hearty and loving thanks
saying That she nothing doubted of their true hearts
towards her: yet was she loth to make any proof
or trial thereof in such quarrel as should be with loss of blood.
"For to repress them with violence, and subdue them by the
sword could not have so happy success but many of my
poor subjects" quod she, "should dearly bye [<i>abide</i>] it with the
loss of their lives." Wherefore she determined to suffer as
long as she might; and to forbear that practice till there
were no other hope ne remedy. For albeit in the capital
traitors there could be but great default: yet in the multitude
she was persuaded to be no malice, but only misled by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Captains; and rather seduced by ignorance than upon any
evil purpose meant to her Grace. Wherefore she desired
them to be contented: for she was fully determined to continue
her merciful sufferance and other her gentle means so
long as she might; and [to] vanquish her enemies without
the sword, if any sparkle of obedience or natural zeal remain
in their hearts. Notwithstanding, she required them to
prepare and retain their force in a readiness, if their [<i>the
rebels'</i>] stony hearts should drive her to use extremity.</p>

<p>But her Highness doubting [<i>fearing</i>] that London, being
her Chamber and a city holden of dear price in her princely
heart, might, by <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and such ruffens [<i>ruffians</i>] as were
with him, be in danger of spoil, to the utter ruin of the
same: her Highness therefore, as a most tender and loving
Governess, went the same day [31st January 1554] in her
royal person to the Guild Hall to foresee those perils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen's
speech in the
Guild Hall
in London.</div>

<p>Where, among other matter proceeding from her incomparable
wisdom, her Grace declared how she had
sent that day two of her Privy Council to the
traitor <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>: desirous rather to quiet their tumult
by mercy than by the justice of the sword to vanquish:
whose most godly heart fraight[ed] with all mercy and
clemency, abhorred from all effusion of blood.</p>

<p>Her Highness also there shewed the insolent and proud
answer returned from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>: whereat the faithful citizens
were much offended; and in plain terms defied him as a
most rank traitor, with all his conjurates.</p>

<p>And touching the Marriage, her Highness affirmed that
nothing was done herein by herself alone, but with consent
and advisement of the whole Council, upon deliberate consultation,
that this conjunction and Second Marriage should
greatly advance this realm (whereunto she was first married)
to much honour, quiet, and gain.</p>

<p>"For," quod her Grace, "I am already married to this
Common Weal and the faithful members of the same; the
spousal ring whereof I have on my finger: which never
hitherto was, nor hereafter shall be, left off. Protesting unto
you nothing to be more acceptable to my heart, nor more
answerable to my will, than your advancement in wealth and
welfare, with the furtherance of GOD's glory." And to
declare her tender and princely heart towards them, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
promised constantly not to depart from them, although by
her Council she had been much moved to the contrary: but
would remain near and prest to adventure the spense
[<i>shedding</i>] of her royal blood in defence of them.</p>

<p>Such matter passed from her besides as did so wonderfully
enamour the hearts of the hearers as it was a world to
hear with what shouts they exalted the honour and
magnanimity of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>

<p>This done her Grace returned towards Whitehall, and
passing through the streets, being full of people pressing to
behold her Grace wherein they had singular delight and
pleasure, one amongst all, most impudent of all others,

<span class="sidenote">A malepert
Artificer.</span>

stepped forward saying, "Your Grace may do
well to make your Foreward [<i>Vanguard</i>] in battle,
of your Bishops and Priests: for they be trusty, and will not
deceive you!"</p>

<p>For which words, he was commanded to Newgate: who
deserved to be hanged at the next bough, for example to all
others, so impudently and arrogantly to assault his Sovereign
and Queen with such seditious and traitorous language. The
voice went that he was a Hosier. Out of all doubt, he was
a traitor and a heretic; whose heart was wholly in <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
bosom, although his body were absent. For it was not
possible any faithful subject, or true Christian, to utter such
shameless speech to his liege Lady and Princess as he did
then. But such is the fruit of heresy, Contempt of GOD
and man; as by daily experience is seen.</p>

far greater number, marched to Deptford strand,
eight miles from Dartford and within four miles of London.
Where, upon such advertisement as he received by espial of

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
marching to
Southwark.</div>

<p>On the Saturday following [3rd February 1554], very
early, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> marched to Southwark: where
approaching the Gate at London Bridge foot, [he]
called for the opening of the same; which he
found not so ready as he looked for.</p>

<p>After he had been a little while in Southwark, divers of
the soldiers went to Winchester Place [<i>the town residence of
the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span></i>]. Where one of them, being a
Gentleman, began to shew his game before all the cards were
full[y] dealed; I mean, to rifle and spoil: which indeed was the
determinate end of their purpose; but the time was not yet
come, nor they come to the place, where they should begin it.</p>

<p>Whereunto <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, having further respect than the young
Gentleman had, shewed himself, with stern and fiery visage,
so much to be offended with his doings that he made divers
believe that he would have hanged him upon the wharf.
Which whereof it grew, either of hatred to the evil, or of
policy to purchase credit for a further mischief, as well the
nature and course of rebellion, as also <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s own words,
may easily let us understand.</p>

<p>Who, the Monday [22nd January 1554] next afore this
stir, devising with two of his friends for the execution of his
pretensed [<i>intended</i>] purpose; one of them at length said
unto him, "I have no doubt but you shall be able to assemble
a great force: but how you shall be able to continue the
same with you, having not sufficient treasure and money,
the only bait wherewith the multitude is holden, I stand
much in doubt."</p>

<p>"What then?" quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<p>"Marry," said the other, "methinketh a good way for your
provision thereof, after your force is once gathered, that ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
apprehend [Sir <span class="smcap">John Cheyney</span>] the Lord Warden, the
Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Southwell</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Moyle</span>, with others; of whose hearts and affections towards
you and your case you stand in doubt: whereby ye shall not
only have them in safety which are most like[ly] within the
Shire to withstand your enterprise; but also provide you
both treasure and money, which they want not, for the relief
of your Band."</p>

<p>"Ah," quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "is this the best counsel ye can give?
If we pretend to keep out Strangers, and begin our quarrel
with the spoil of our own country [<i>County</i>] men; what will
the whole realm, trow ye, then deem of us? Nay, your advice
is naught; and your way, the next way to accelerate our
confusion. For if we will go forwards in our matter and
make the best of it to our purpose, Spoil and Tyranny may
not be our guides. We must, by all means, devise, and all
little enough, to continue good opinion in the heads of the
multitude of some plausible [<i>praiseworthy</i>] end to succeed by
our stir: otherwise we undo ourselves. For perceiving at
our entry that our minds run of spoil: who will not rather
resist us, and abide the adventure of that whereof we bear
them in hand; than to be in certain to be spoiled by us?
And I see no cause why you should doubt of money; seeing
ye know that such Gentlemen as are confedered with us,
keeping appointment; their soldiers shall come ready
furnished to bear their own charges for nine days: and our
hap shall be very hard if we be not at London shortly after
we stir; and that with so great a company as shall be out of
danger to be stopped by any of the Shire upon such a sudden,
or letted [<i>hindered</i>] of entry into London finding half the

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
reckoning of the spoil of the Tower and London.</span>

friends there as we think to have. And being once in
London, and having the Tower in our hands; I
trust you think we shall not lack money long after
if any be to be had there, or in the Aldermen's
coffers."</p>

<p>To that said another, that had spoken as yet never a word,
"I know Commoners in London that have more ready money
than some of the Aldermen."</p>

<p>"Soft," quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "I pray you in any wise forbear all
such talk till we come to the place where we would be. In
mean time let us work secretly; and by all tokens and signs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
shew ourselves to favour and maintain our pretence of
Strangers only."</p>

<p>Such and the like communication was between <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
and two others the Monday [22nd January] before his
rising. Whereby it is evident that their final intent was
to advance themselves by spoil of other men's goods:
although they pretended otherwise.</p>

<p>And to colour [<i>make pretence of</i>] the same, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> so fell
out with this Gentleman for rifling the Lord Chancellor's
House [<i>i.e., the House in Southwark of <span class="smcap">Stephen Gardiner</span>,
Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span></i>,] that he made a number believe he
would have hanged him out of hand: had not <span class="smcap">Bret</span> and
others entreated for him.</p>

<p>When they had lien in Southwark a day or two, and
found themselves deceived in London: which (by
the great diligence and politic handling of that
worthy and faithful Knight, the Lord <span class="smcap">William
Howard</span>, Admiral of England, that had the
special charge thereof; with the aid of Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Wight</span>,
Knight, Mayor of London, his brethren [the Aldermen] and
citizens) was so well preserved as the traitors thereby
were disappointed of that they looked most certainly for&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>,
as a man desperate and setting all at sixe[s] and
seven, adventuring the breaking down of a wall out of a

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s coming
into the
Porter's Lodge
at the Bridge
foot.</span>

house joining to the Gate at the Bridge foot,
whereby he might enter into the leads over the
Gate, came down into the Lodge about eleven
of the clock in the night: where he found the

<span class="sidenote">Care away.</span>

Porter in a slumber; [and] his wife with others
waking, watching a coal.</p>

<p>But seeing <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, they began suddenly to start as
greatly amazed.</p>

<p>"Whist!" quod <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, "as you love your lives, sit you
still! You shall have no hurt!"</p>

<p>Glad were they of that warranty, pardye! What should
they do, people better accustomed with the tankard of beer
to pass forth the night, than acquainted with target and
spear to endure the fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and a few with him went forth as far as the
Drawbridge [in the middle of London Bridge]: on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
further side whereof he saw the Lord Admiral, the Lord
Mayor, Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew Judd</span>, and one or two others in consultation
for ordering of the Bridge: whereunto he gave
diligent ear a good time, and [was] not seen. At length
[he] conceived by their talk more than he could digest;
and, perceiving the great ordnance there bent, returned,
saying to his mates, "This place is too hot for us."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And when he was come to his colleges [<i>colleagues</i>], and
declared upon his exploit what he had heard and seen;
they then all together fell to a new council what was to be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rebels at
their wits'
end.</div>

<p>Some would then return to Greenwich, and so pass the
water into Essex (whereby their company as they
thought should increase), and enter into London
by Ald Gate.</p>

<p>And some would to Kingston-upon-Thames, and so
further west[ward].</p>

<p>And some, of the which <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> himself was chief, would
return into Kent to meet with the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>,
the Sheriff, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Moyle</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Kemp</span>, Sir
<span class="smcap">Thomas Finch</span>, that were at Rochester, coming on <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
back with a great company well appointed: falsely persuading
himself that he should find among them more
friends than enemies. But whether his desire to return into
Kent grew upon hope he had to find aid there; or whether
it was to shift himself away; it was much doubted of his
own company. And some of them that knew him well,
except they were much deceived, reported not long before
their execution, that his desire to retire into Kent was only
to shift himself over the sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The Lord Warden's being at Rochester
towards <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</div>

<p>The Lord Warden [Sir <span class="smcap">John Cheyney</span>] being now
come to Rochester, as ye heard, and very honourably
furnished with horse and men well appointed,
to no small number, entering into consultation
with such Gentlemen as were there, for the
better proceeding in their service, shewed a great desire
to accelerate the onset upon the traitors: lest malice
should impute both his former and present stay rather to
want of forwardness than to good policy. Wherefore he
desired to pursue after them with all expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereunto the Gentlemen, being then in arms with him,
said, "As for your Lordship's contation [<i>delay</i>] hitherto,
it shall be weighed not as fools by fancy and malice deem;
but as wise men shall measure it by their discretion of
wisdom. We see not but unadvised hardiness [<i>rashness</i>]
and preproperous [? <i>preposterous</i>] haste in most matters
have these two companions: Error in the beginning, and
Repentance in the end. And for this our case, whoso
understandeth the same cannot but confess your Lordship's
deliberate forbearing to have proceeded of great wisdom,
as wherein haste could little prevail. And whereas your
Lordship is so desirous to pursue after <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his
Band, you see how they have lien in Southwark and within
four miles of London these four days [Thursday 1st, to
Sunday 4th February 1554]; and yet not meddled with by
the Queen's army, being so near: which is neither for want
of men, nor of forwardness in that noble Gentleman,

<span class="sidenote">The Earl of
<span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>,
the Queen's
Lieutenant.</span>

the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>, the Queen's
Lieutenant; but upon great policy and further
respect no doubt than we seem to conceive.</p>

<p>"Wherefore your Lordship may do better to pause,
and first to advertise the Queen's Majesty and the Lord
Lieutenant [the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>] both what your Lordship,
upon grave and deep consideration, hath conceived in
this doubtful time, and also in what readiness your Lordship
is, and other Gentlemen with you: whose pleasures known,
we may then happily proceed in service; both with good
contentation to them above [us], and best surety for ourselves.
Otherwise if fortune should not favour our journey
[<i>expedition</i>], there may be thought in us more impotent
will to haste than provident policy to speed. And danger
hereby can none follow, our enemies lying between her
Grace's army and us: considering withal that London
is so well furnished, and so willing to resist their entry."</p>

<p>Whereupon the Lord Warden went in post to the Queen;
leaving the Lord <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> and the rest of the
Gentlemen with his and their Bands until his return: which
was very shortly after. [See Vol. IV. p. 92.]</p>

<p>Who, according to his first purpose, with the rest of
the Gentlemen, marched forth towards <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>. Which who
had seen so well appointed, and with what willing hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
they went; and had known withal the faithful dealing of
sundry Gentlemen besides in other parts of the Shire, ought
to say, That notwithstanding there were many evil; yet were
there many worthy, Gentlemen and honest faithful yeomen
in Kent, free from <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s conspiracy: and that the same
[would] receive some injury at his hand that, taking upon
him to set forth any Chronicle, should name only four
Gentlemen of this Shire to be workers against <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.
For though every man pursued him not in the beginning,
many of them dwelling far from him: yet were they as
well occupied where they were, and as much towards
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s confusion, by staying and withholding [a] great
force, through their earnest persuasions and labour, that
else would have been with <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now to return to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>: whom in this meantime <span class="smcap">Bret</span>
and the other Captains espying to have a desire to be gone,
dissembling the knowledge thereof, [they] wrought all the
secret means they could devise to stay his going; as
having the weight of their lives depending upon this enterprise
as well as he.</p>

<p>One of them, by agreement in their consultation, said
to him: "You see," quod he, "with what difficulty you
keep your soldiers here: notwithstanding they be in a
town where they are in a manner as pent in, and thereby
the more uneasy to get away; being so narrowly looked to.
And now if you shall leave the town and retire into Kent,
as some of your company suspect you will, whereby they
and all others shall judge you to be in despair of the aid
of London; the hope whereof hath been hitherto the
greatest occasion of stay of such as be already here, and
the comfort for the coming of others to the increase of
your power: you may assure yourself that such as be
here will not tarry long after with you, finding time to
escape as they shall easily enough, being at large; nor
such as be absent will have haste to repair unto you, when
they shall perceive you to be in despair of London. And
so you shall weaken yourself, to the comfort of your enemies
and discomfort of your friends."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bret</span>, under colour [<i>pretence</i>] of singular affection to
<span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, devising an apt occasion to avoid suspicion (which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
wanted not among them), required to speak with him
apart; and having him alone, said:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bret</span>'s words
to <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>.</div>

<p>"It shall not be amiss that, for your own surety, you have
in remembrance the effect of the several Proclamations
made at Dartford: the one by Master <span class="smcap">William
Roper</span>, wherein you were betraitored; the other by
Master <span class="smcap">Appulton</span>, which, as I hear, was also made at London
and in other parts of the realm, wherein is promised the
inheritance of One Hundred Pounds [in] land to such as
can apprehend and present you to the Queen.</p>

<p>"Now what fantasies may grow into the heads of your
own fellows, for the safeguard of themselves; of whom you
have had already some experience, it is to be doubted: or
what may grow in the heads of your soldiers when, failing
of the aid of London, they shall be in despair of your
enterprise, it is also to be doubted. On the other part,
when such of Kent, on whom it seemeth you repose some
trust, shall hear of your retire: their disposition perhaps
will be much changed. And therefore it standeth you in
hand to look to the matter substantially."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trustless
traitors!</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> (having the same confidence in <span class="smcap">Bret</span>, that <span class="smcap">Bret</span>
would <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> to have had in others; remembering
his most deceitful treason to the Queen,
contrary to the trust reposed in him for the conduct of the
White Coats; and feeling his grief doubled, and his desire
to convey himself away so much the more increased, by
<span class="smcap">Bret</span>'s secret talk with him); as a stricken deer, wandereth
aside, all alone complaining with himself [of] his most
unhappy fate.</p>

<p>And soon after calling <span class="smcap">Thomas Isley</span> unto him, said,
"Ah, cousin <span class="smcap">Isley</span>, in what extreme misery are we?
The revolt of these Captains with the White Coats seemed
a benefit in the beginning; and as a thing sent by GOD
for our good, and to comfort us forward in our enterprise:
which I now feel to our confusion. Ah, cousin, this it is
to enter such a quarrel, which notwithstanding we now see
must have a ruthful end; yet of necessity we must prosecute
the same."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> as desperate (finding others to accord with <span class="smcap">Bret</span>'s
opinion, upon his conference with them: by whom for
direction of his traitorous journey [<i>expedition</i>] he was chiefly
advised; although for this shifting away there were others

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
marching to Kingston.</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>

whom he better trusted) marched, the Tuesday being Shrove
Tuesday [6th February 1554], out of Southwark to
Kingston upon Thames, ten miles distant; where
they arrived about four of the clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>And finding thirty feet or thereabouts of the bridge taken
away, saving the posts that were left standing; <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> practiced
[<i>bargained</i>] with two mariners to swim over to convey
a barge unto him. Which the mariners, tempted with great

<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s
passage at
Kingston.</span>

promises of preferment, did. Wherein <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and certain
with him were conveyed over: who, in the time
that the number of the soldiers baited [<i>lunched</i>] in
the town, caused the bridge to be trimmed with
ladders planks and beams, the same tied together with ropes
and boards as, by ten of the clock in the night, [it] was in
such plight that both his ordnance and Band of men might
pass over without peril.</p>

<p>And so, about eleven of the clock in the same night, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>
with his Band, without either resistance or peril, marched
over the bridge towards London; having such a loving heart
in his body to the Queen as before day he meant to have
been at the Court Gate [of Whitehall]. Which he could
never have attempted, having any sparkle of that good zeal
in his breast to the Queen's surety as, to further his treason,
he outwardly pretended to the World; considering the
danger that might have grown, by the fear thereof, to her
Grace.</p>

<p>But, as GOD would, partly by weariness of his soldiers,
and partly by the breach [<i>break down</i>] of the wheels that
carried his ordnance; it was nine of the clock of the day
following, being Ash Wednesday [7th February 1554], before
he came so far as Hyde Park: where his courage, being
tofore as ye have heard not very lusty, began now utterly to
die; beholding as it were before his face the present bane
and confusion whereunto his malicious intent was shaped.</p>

<p>Yet desperation being his lewd guide, he marcheth forward;
and cometh within the power of Sir <span class="smcap">William
Herbert</span>, Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>; being, that day, the Queen's
Lieutenant General in the field. Who yet (with divers other
Noblemen and faithful subjects, being then in arms with him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
prest and ready to receive so impudent a race of traitorous
rebels to their deserved breakfast) understanding, partly by
sure spial, partly by their own view, that the rebels exceeded
not the number of four thousand, and most of them naked
[<i>unarmed</i>], void of all policy and skill; considering withal
that they could not set upon <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and his whole Band but
great effusion of blood should follow, the Queen's army
being so greedy to be revenged and the other so impotent to
resist, determined rather by policy to achieve the victory
than by bloodshed to confound the rebels. Wherein they
should please GOD, answer the Queen's merciful expectation,
and purchase unto themselves most renown and honour
of that day's service.</p>

<p>Upon these resolutions, they permitted <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> with the
fore part of his Band to pass quietly along; and through
between the Queen's Majesty's Horsemen: the Lord
<span class="smcap">Clinton</span> being Marshal of the Field and Captain of the
barbed horses and Demi-lances on the south side; <span class="smcap">Jack</span> of
<span class="smcap">Musgrave</span> being Captain of the Light Horsemen on the
north side. The great ordnance being charged to shoot full
upon the breast of the rebels coming eastward: the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> with the Main Battle of footmen as well for
handguns, morishpikes, bows, and bills, standing in goodly
array on the north-east side, behind the said great ordnance,
ready to set upon the rebels in the face coming towards
Holborn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, coming in the forefront of his Band, perceiving that
he was thus beset with horsemen on both sides, the great
ordnance and the footmen before his face north-eastward; so
that he could no ways escape, but necessarily must fall into
their hands, although for policy he was suffered and a great
part of his men to pass so far quietly and without resistance
through the Horsemen&mdash;he suddenly forsook his way
intended through Holborn; and, with might and main, as
fast as they could, he and his mates ran down underneath the
Park Wall of brick adjoining to the Queen's Manor House,
called St. James's.</p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>, observing his time; first with his
Demi-lances brake their array, and divided <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s Band in
two parts. Then came the Light Horsemen, who so hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
pursued the tail of his Band, that they slew many, hurt more,
and took most of them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst the said Horsemen were thus in fight with the tail
of his Band; <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> himself and 500 men or thereabouts
peked [<i>pushed</i>] on still all along under St. James's Park Wall
until he came to Charing Cross: where divers of the Queen's
Household servants and others fought with them, and in the
end killed 16 of the rebels.</p>

<p>Nevertheless <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, having escaped with a part of his
company, marching along in battle [ar]ray, entered into
Fleet street, and came over Fleet Bridge towards Lud Gate.</p>

<p>And although no man resisted his passage through the
streets thus far: yet, when at length he perceived that he
had no help of friends at London and the suburbs as he
looked for, [he] left his men standing still in battle array;
and rode back as far as the Temple Bar Gate, with a
naked [<i>drawn</i>] sword in his hands the hilts upward, as some
report.</p>

<p>At which Gate, he would have gone through towards
Charing Cross, to the residue of his men: but he was then
stopped by force, of the Queen's true subjects; who would
not suffer him to pass without Temple Bar.</p>

<p>At length came one Sir <span class="smcap">Maurice Berkeley</span> Knight unto
him, and required him to consider that he could not prevail
in this wicked purpose; and that his men were all taken and
slain in the Field: and therefore willed him to cease off
from any further occasion of bloodshed; exhorting him to
yield himself prisoner, and to stand to the Queen's mercy.</p>

<p>Which to do, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> refused; and said That he would
rather be slain than yield to any man.</p>

<p>And yet, nevertheless, as it chanced, there came a Herald
of Arms immediately, riding in the Queen's Coat Armour to
this place: to his Coat shortly after <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> submitted himself
prisoner; and so went to the Court at Westminster, and
there was brought before the Privy Council; and shortly
after, within one hour, sent from thence to the Tower of
London [a] prisoner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amongst other things this is to be remembered, that
whiles the said <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> and certain of his men, as aforesaid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
were coming thus towards Fleet street; a certain Captain of
the said rebels, with divers of his soldiers, returned from
Charing Cross down to the Court Gate at Whitehall, and
gave a larum [<i>an alarm</i>] before the Gate: and shot divers
arrows into the said Court, the Gate being open. Insomuch
that one Master <span class="smcap">Nicholas Rockewood</span>, being a Gentleman
of Lincoln's Inn and in armour at the said Court Gate, was
shot through his nose with an arrow by the rebels. [<i>See
<span class="smcap">Edward Underhill</span>'s account of this fright at</i> Vol. IV.,
p. 92.]</p>

<p>For the coming of the said rebels was not looked for that
way: but [it was] thought that the Queen's army should
have joined battle with them in the Field; according to
promise made by the said <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> on his behalf: who promised
that he would come to the Queen's Foot Battle
[<i>Infantry</i>], and fight with them pike against pike and man
to man. Which, when it came to the very point, he
refused; and shrank [by] a bye way by Saint James's Park
Wall for his refuge, as you have heard before: where many
of them were slain by Horsemen, so that they came not nigh
the Queen's power of the Foot Battle. Which increased
some desperate boldness in the despairing rebels: not
without great discomfiture to all the Court and the city
of London; perceiving that he was himself, and so many
rebels with him, come through the Queen's army thus
far.</p>

<p>Whereupon grew great admiration [<i>wonderment</i>] amongst
them that knew not their doings in the Field: how for policy,
and to avoid much manslaughter, <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> was suffered purposely
to pass along. Insomuch divers timorous and cold
hearted soldiers came to the Queen, crying, "All is lost!
Away! Away! A barge! A barge!"</p>

<p>Yet her Grace never changed her cheer, nor removed
one foot out of the House: but asked for the Lord of
<span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>, in whom her Grace had worthily reposed great
confidence.</p>

<p>Answer being made, That he was in the Field.</p>

<p>"Well then," quod her Grace, "fall to prayer! and I
warrant you, we shall hear better news anon. For my Lord
will not deceive me, I know well. If he would, GOD will
not: in whom my chief trust is, who will not deceive me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
And indeed, shortly after, news came all of victory, [and]
how that <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> was taken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This day [7th February 1554], the Judges in the Common
Place [<i>Common Pleas</i>] at Westminster sat in armour. The
Mayor, Aldermen, and the householders of the city, by four
of the clock in the morning, were in armour: the Lord
<span class="smcap">William Howard</span>, High Admiral, being amongst them.
Who, as I have tofore said, was by the Queen's Majesty
appointed Captain General and Lieutentant for the time,
to confer in counsel and join in execution with the Lord
Mayor and his Brethren [the Aldermen] for the sure
and speedy guarding and warding of the city: to the
preservation whereof the Queen's Grace had special regard.
The Gates were diligently watched; every Gate with 100
men: Moor Gate being closed up and rampired.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus was this wily heretic and open traitor <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, and
his complices, brought to their confusion; and to the end
which never missed all such malicious[ly] disposed wretches.
Partly by the wisdom and policy of him that was armed in
the Field, the worthy Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>; but chiefly by the
mighty hand of GOD, at the contemplation of her high
merits and virtues; who remaining in the closet of stedfast
hope and confidence, being appointed with the armour of
faith, fought with ardent and continual prayer, in perfect
devotion, under the banner and ensign of GOD: who indeed
alone gave this victory, and alone without policy or might of
man overthrew her enemies; yet so that he therewith
declared his special favour and pleasure towards his servant,
that noble Knight, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>, in appointing him
chief champion this day to defend his chosen and elect
Virgin; whose faith hath not been wavering in his Catholic
religion nor his truth and service doubtful at any time
towards his Prince.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>, as is said, was committed to the Tower. So were
divers other Gentlemen: as, soon after, was <span class="smcap">Henry Grey</span>
Duke of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span> and his two brethren.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Duke of
<span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>'s
apprehension
by the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Hastings</span>.</div>

<p>The Duke, being so hardly pursued by the Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Hastings</span>, Earl of <span class="smcap">Huntingdon</span>, was by him apprehended
in Leicestershire. Whereby he declared
himself, as well in honour and unspotted loyalty
as in parentage and patrimony, to succeed his great
grandfather the Lord <span class="smcap">Hastings</span>; whose fidelity
and stedfast truth towards King <span class="smcap">Edward IV.</span> and his
children, the Chronicles report to his immortal honour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the common people there was such a number taken in
the chase by the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> that besides the usual
gaols, sundry churches in London were made places for their

<p>The Duke [of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>] was arraigned by his Peers, and
by verdict found guilty of Treason, before the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>, being Lord Constable, and that day his Judge.
Both he, and his brother <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, at several days, made
their end at Tower Hill, by loss of their heads.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sundry others of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s complices, being arraigned, and
condemned upon their confession of treason, suffered in
divers parts of the Shire, as:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Isley</span> Knight, <span class="smcap">Thomas Isley</span> his brother, and
<span class="smcap">Walter Mentel</span>, at Maidstone; where <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> first
displayed his standard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony Knevet</span>, <span class="smcap">William</span> his brother, with another
of the <span class="smcap">Mantels</span>, at Sevenoaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bret</span>, at Rochester, hanging in chains.</p>

<p>And of the common sort very few were executed, save
only of the White Coats; that, to say truth, deserved it
trebly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyat</span> himself, last of all, was arraigned at Westminster;
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Hastings</span>, and Sir
<span class="smcap">Thomas Cornwallis</span> being his Judges: where and before
whom, he most earnestly craved life; not by plea of his
matter or justifying of himself, but by earnest suit, in
humble submission, for the Queen's mercy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s words
at his arraignment.</div>

<p>It seemeth not amiss here to make report of such special
words as by him were uttered at his arraignment:
which I myself heard, standing not ten feet from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
him at that time. By the which words may appear
both what he himself thought of his doings, how much
he misliked the same, and also how penitent and sorrowful
he was therefor.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left: -0.3em;">MY Lords, I must confess myself guilty; as, in</span>
the end, truth must enforce me to say: and
that I am justly plagued for my sins, which
most grievously I have committed against GOD;
who hath suffered me to fall into this beastly
brutishness and horrible offence of treason. And lo, in
me the like end; as all such that have attempted like
enterprizes, from the beginning have had. For peruse
the Chronicles throughout, and you shall find that rebellion
never from the beginning prospered. For the love of GOD,
all you Gentlemen that be here present remember! and
be here taught by the examples past, and also by this
my present infelicity and heinous offence!</p>

<p>"O most miserable, mischievous, brutish, and beastly
furious imagination of mine! For I thought that by the
marriage of the Prince of Spain, this realm should have been
in danger: and that I, that have lived a free born man,
should, with my country, have been brought to bondage and
servitude by aliens and Strangers. Which brutish beastliness
then seemed reason; and wrought so far and to such
effect as it led me to the practice and use of this committed
treason: that now understanding the great commodity
honour and surety which this realm shall receive by this
marriage; if it shall please the Queen to be merciful to me
there is no man living that shall be more trusty and faithful
to serve her Grace; no, nor more ready to die at her
Highness's foot, whatsoever the quarrel be."</p>

<p>Thus far touching <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s words at his arraignment,
I thought not superfluous here to report, to the end that all
others blindly fallen into the same error, would by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
example of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> rise also to repentance; as well confessing
to the World with open voice their detestable mischief, as
also from the very heart with tears detesting the same; as, in
utterance of the former words, he plentifully did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He lost his head at Tower Hill; and his body, divided,
was set up in divers parts about London.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other poor men, being taken in <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s Band, and kept a
time in divers churches and prisons without the

<span class="sidenote">Of such as did penance by wearing halters before
the Queen.</span>

city [of London], kneeling all, with halters about
their necks, before the Queen's Highness at
Whitehall; her Grace mercifully pardoned, to the
number of 600: who immediately thereupon, with great
shouts, casting their halters up into the air, cried "GOD
save your Grace! GOD save your Grace!"</p>

<p>Howbeit sundry of them that did wear halters afore the
Queen's Highness were afterwards, by means, called before
the Justices in the country to be arraigned: but her Grace,
being moved thereof by the Sheriff, would them to be no
further vexed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus have ye heard of <span class="smcap">Wyat</span>'s end, and [of] some of his
complices: by whose lamentable tragedy, and others of like
sort that happened in our Age, not only we, but such as
shall succeed us, may be abundantly taught to foresee what
it is to enter into rebellion. For neither could <span class="smcap">Wyat</span> with
his stoutness, nor yet with the pretence of his quarrel
coloured with a meaning to defend his country from overrunning
by Strangers, nor yet through the aid of sundry
conspirators of great power, ne by any other policy, prevail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six of the Gentlemen that were offenders were pardoned,
going to their execution, by the Queen's clemency, at
Rochester: as were also all the others of the whole Kentish
Gentlemen remitted; a few of the rankest excepted, that,
only for example, suffered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Queen's Highness, not long after, sent out her
Commission to Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Moyle</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">John Guildford</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94 " id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Kemp</span>; <span class="smcap">Warram Sentleger</span>, <span class="smcap">Thomas
Roydon</span>, <span class="smcap">Christopher Roper</span>, <span class="smcap">George Dorrell</span> of
Calehill, <span class="smcap">George Fane</span>, <span class="smcap">John Tucke</span>, <span class="smcap">John Robarts</span>,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Lovelace</span>, <span class="smcap">John Leonard</span>, Esquires; with others:
not only to bail and set at large such as were in prison in the
country [<i>County of Kent</i>] for that offence, being of no small
number; but also to compound [<i>fine</i>] with the offenders,
according to the quality of their offences. Which manner of
order, being not heard of in the like case, or at the least very
rarely, declared a singular clemency and benignity in the
Queen: that, being followed so cruelly, would yet be so
moved with pity as to vouchsafe to answer them with so
much lenity, in the executing of so few, in comparison
to so great a number and so large a cause; being all in her
Grace's mercy to dispose at her pleasure. And besides [to]
suffer the rest to escape with so small abashment of their
countenance [<i>small amount of fine</i>] after so heinous [an]
offence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He that shall peruse this Story diligently, and consider
all parts thereof exactly, with remembrance of things past
since the beginning of the Queen's most happy reign, must
of force recognize, of what condition soever he be, the
magnificence mercy and fortitude of this most noble Princess,
as from time to time with such patience to endure so great
malice of her own subjects, with such lenity to forbear the
revenge of so intolerable outrage, with such mercy in the
end to pardon and remit so heinous and great offenders.
Happy was it with those heinous offenders that her Grace's
most worthy and honourable Council were so agreeable to
her virtuous inclination! as inclined rather to pursue
merciful pardon for continuance of life than to prosecute
revenge by execution of death.</p>

<p>It is to be wished by all good men with one assent that,
provoked with so great clemency, these degenerates reform
themselves! and forbear thus to attempt so gracious a
Princess! unto whom, by GOD's authority, the sword is not
vainly committed; lest thereby they procure to themselves
damnation in seeking by such outrage their own death and
confusion. From the desire whereof we see, by a number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
evident arguments, the Queen's Highness and her honourable
Council to be so far as, by all means they can imagine,
they seek to eschew that they by most wilful
and malicious means follow to their subversion.

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em">ON</span> Wednesday, being the 4th day of June
in the year of our Lord 1561 (and in the
3rd year of the reign of our Sovereign
Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, by the Grace of God,
Queen of England France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.), between one
and two of the clock at afternoon, was
seen a marvellous great fiery lightning;
and immediately ensued a most terrible hideous crack of
thunder, such as seldom hath been heard; and that, by
estimation of sense, directly over the city of London. At
which instant, the corner of a turret of the Steeple of St
Martin's Church within Lud Gate was torn; and divers
great stones casten down; and a hole broken through the
roof and timber of the said Church by the fall of the same
stones.</p>

<p>For divers persons (in time of the said tempest, being on
the river of Thames; and others being in the fields near
adjoining to the city) affirmed that they saw a long and
spear-pointed flame of fire, as it were, run through the top of
the broche [<i>or spire</i>] or shaft of Paul's Steeple; from the
East, westward. And some of the parish of St Martin's,
then being in the street, did feel a marvellous strong air or
whirlwind, with a smell like brimstone, coming from Paul's
Church; and withal heard a rush of the stones which fell
from their Steeple into the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Between four and five of the clock, a smoke was espied by
divers to break out under the bowl of the said shaft of Paul's;
and namely [<i>particularly</i>] by <span class="smcap">Peter Johnson</span>, Principal
Registrar to the Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>; who immediately
brought word to the Bishop's House.</p>

<p>But, suddenly after, as it were in a moment, the flame
brake forth in a circle, like a garland, round about the broche,
about two yards, to the estimation of sight, under the bowl
of the said shaft; and increased in such wise that, within a
quarter of an hour, or little more, the Cross and the Eagle
on the top fell down upon the South cross Ile [<i>Aisle</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Lord Mayor being sent for, and his Bretheren [the
Aldermen], came with all speed possible; and had a short
consultation, as in such a case might be, with the Bishop of
<span class="smcap">London</span> and others, for the best way of remedy. And
thither came also [Sir <span class="smcap">Nicholas Bacon</span>] the Lord Keeper
of the Great Seal, and [<span class="smcap">William Paulet</span>, Marquis of
<span class="smcap">Winchester</span>] the Lord Treasurer: who, by their wisdom
and authority, directed as good order as in so great confusion
could possibly be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some there were, pretending experience in wars, that
counselled the remnant of the Steeple to be shot down with
cannons; which counsel was not liked, as most perilous both
for the dispersing [of] the fire, and [the] destruction of houses
and people.</p>

<p>Others (perceiving the Steeple to be past all recovery;
considering the hugeness of the fire, and the dropping of the
lead) thought best to get ladders, and scale the Church; and
with axes to hew down a space of the roof of the Church to
stay the fire, at the least to save some part of the said
Church: which was concluded [<i>decided upon</i>]. But before
the ladders and buckets could be brought, and things put in
any order (and especially because the Church was of such
height that they could not scale it, and no sufficient number
of axes could be had: the labourers also being troubled with
the multitude of idle gazers); the most part of the highest
roof of the Church was on fire.</p>

<p>First, the fall of the Cross and Eagle fired the South cross
Ile [<i>Aisle</i>]; which Ile was first consumed. The beams and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
brands of the Steeple fell down on every side, and fired the
other three parts: that is to say, the Chancel or Quire, the
North Ile, and the body of the Church. So that, in one
hour's space, the broche [<i>or spire</i>] of the Steeple was burnt
down to the battlements; and the most part of the highest
roof of the Church likewise consumed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The state of the Steeple and Church seeming both
desperate; my Lord Mayor was advised, by one Master
<span class="smcap">Winter</span> of the Admiralty [<i>i.e. Admiral Sir <span class="smcap">William
Winter</span></i>], to convert the most part of his care and provision
to preserve the Bishop's Palace adjoining to the north-west
end of the Church; lest from that House, being large, the
fire might spread to the streets adjoining. Whereupon the
ladders, buckets, and labourers were commanded thither;
and, by great labour and diligence, a piece of the roof of the
North Ile was cut down, and the fire so stayed: and, by
much water, that part quenched; and the said Bishop's
House preserved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It pleased GOD also, at the same time, both to turn, and
calm, the wind: which afore was vehement; and continued
still high and great in other parts without the city.</p>

<p>There were above 500 persons that laboured in carrying
and filling water, &amp;c. Divers substantial citizens took pains
as if they had been labourers; so did also divers and sundry
Gentlemen, whose names were not known to the Writer
hereof: but amongst others, the said Master <span class="smcap">Winter</span>, and
one Master <span class="smcap">Stranguish</span>, did both take notable pains in
their own persons; and also much directed and encouraged
others, and that not without great danger to themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the evening, came the Lord <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>, [the] Lord
Admiral, from the Court at Greenwich; whom the Queen's
Majesty (as soon as the rage of the fire was espied by Her
Majesty and others in the Court, of the pitiful inclination
and love that her gracious Highness did bear both to the
said Church and the city) sent to assist my Lord Mayor, for
the suppressing of the fire: who, with his wisdom authority
and diligent travail, did very much good therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>About ten of the clock, the fierceness of the fire was past,
the timber being fallen and lying burning upon the vaults of
stone; the vaults yet (GOD be thanked!) standing unperished.
So as only the timber of the whole Church was
consumed, and the lead molten: saving the most part of the
two low Iles of the Quire, and a piece of the North Ile, and
another small piece of the South Ile in the body of the
Church.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all which, it pleased the merciful GOD,
in his wrath, to remember his mercy; and to enclose the
harm of this most fierce and terrible fire within the walls of
this one Church: not extending any part of his wrath in this
fire upon the rest of the city, which to all reason and sense
of man was subject to utter destruction. For in the whole
city, without the Church, no stick was kindled surely. Notwithstanding
that, in divers parts and streets, and within the
houses both adjoining and of a good distance, as in Fleet
Street and Newgate Market, by the violence of the fire,
burning coals of great bigness fell down almost as thick as
hailstones; and flaws of lead were blown abroad into the
gardens without the city, like flaws of snow in breadth:
without hurt (GOD be thanked!) to any house or person.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many fond talks go abroad of the original cause of this.
Some say, It was negligence of plumbers: whereas, by due
examination, it is proved that no plumbers or other workmen
laboured in the Church for six months before. Others
suspect that it was done by some wicked practice of wild
fire or gunpowder: but no just suspicions thereof, by any
examination, can be found hitherto. Some suspect Conjurors
and Sorcerers, whereof there is also no great likelihood:
and if it had been wrought that way; yet could not
the Devil have done it without GOD's permission, and to
some purpose of his unsearchable judgments, as appeareth
in the story of <span class="smcap">Job</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The true cause, as it seemeth, was the tempest, by GOD's
sufferance. For it cannot be otherwise gathered, but that,
at the said great and terrible thunderclap, when St Martin's
Steeple was torn, the lightning (which by natural order
smiteth the highest) did first smite the top of Paul's Steeple;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and entering in at the small holes, which have always
remained open for building scaffolds to the works, and finding
the timber very old and dry, did kindle the same: and
so the fire increasing, grew to a flame, and wrought the
effect which followed; most terrible then to behold, and now
most lamentable to look upon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Sunday following, being the 8th day of June [1561],
the reverend [Father] in GOD [<span class="smcap">James Pilkington</span>] Bishop
of <span class="smcap">Durham</span>, at St Paul's Cross, made a learned and fruitful
Sermon; exhorting the auditory to a general repentance,
and namely [<i>especially</i>] to humble obedience to the laws and
Superior Powers, which virtue is much decayed in these our
days: seeming to have intelligence from the Queen's Highness,
that Her Majesty intendeth more severity of laws shall
be executed against persons disobedient, as well in causes of
Religion as Civil; to the great rejoicing of his auditors.</p>

<p>He exhorted also his audience to take this as a general
warning to the whole realm, and namely [<i>especially</i>] to the
city of London, of some greater plague to follow if amendment
of life in all [e]states did not ensue. He much
reproved those persons which would assign the cause of this
wrath of GOD to any particular [e]state of men; or that
were diligent to look into other men's lives, and could see
no faults in themselves: but wished that every man would
descend into himself and say with <span class="smcap">David</span>, <i>Ego sum qui
peccavi</i>. "I am he that hath sinned." And so forth to that
effect, very godly.</p>

<p>He also not only reproved the profanation of the said
Church of Paul's, of long time heretofore abused [<i>in Paul's
Walk</i>] by walking, jangling, brawling, fighting, bargaining,
&amp;c., namely [<i>particularly</i>] in Sermon and Service time: but
also answered by the way to the objections of such evil-tongued
persons which do impute this token of GOD's
deserved ire to alteration, or rather, Reformation of Religion;
declaring out of ancient records and histories the like,
yea, and greater matters, [that] had befallen in the time of
superstition and ignorance.</p>

<p>For, in the 1st year of King <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> [1135-6 A.D.]
not only the said Church of Paul's was burnt: but also a
great part of the city: that is to say, from London Bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to St Clement's [Church] without Temple Bar, was by fire
consumed.</p>

<p>And in the days of King <span class="smcap">Henry VI.</span>, the Steeple of Paul's
was also fired by lightning: although it was then stayed by
diligence of the citizens; the fire being then, by likelihood,
not so fierce.</p>

<p>Many other such like common calamities he rehearsed,
which happened in other countries, both nigh to this realm

<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">The conceit of this Idillion is very delicate. Wherein it is imagined

dainty youth whom she loved: and how the Boar answering for
himself that he slew him against his will, as being enamoured on
him, and thinking only to kiss his naked thigh; she forgave him.
The Poet's drift is to shew the power of Love, not only in men, but
also in brute beasts: although in the last two verses, by the burning
of the Boar's amorous teeth, he intimateth that extravagant and
unorderly passions are to be restrained by reason.</span></p>

<p>If this <span class="smcap">George Gascoigne</span>, who, as his handwriting shows, is
doubtless the Soldier-Poet, left Paris on the 8th October, he could
very well have come to Antwerp, as the Writer of this narrative states,
at page <a href="#Page_149">149</a>, he did, by the 22nd of that month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span> the Poet was a very tall man, so that he was called
"long <span class="smcap">George</span>." This he seems to refer to at page
<a href="#Page_155">155</a>, where he says,
"I got up like a tall fellow."</p>

<p>For further confirmation of <span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span> being the Author,
see pp. <a href="#Page_164">164-6</a> .</p>

<p>2. The best Plan of Antwerp, about the time of the Spanish Fury,
that we have met with, is that of <span class="smcap">George Braun</span>'s <i>Civitates Orbis
Terrarum</i>, Vol. I., Plan 17.</p>

<p>3. All the dates in the following narrative are Old Style.</p>

<p>4. It is to be specially noted that Antwerp was a Roman Catholic
city that had never, <i>in the least way possible</i>, rebelled against <span class="smcap">Philip</span>
II.; and that its awful destruction was made, without the least provocation,
by the soldiers of its Sovereign, that should have protected it. Its
only crime was its great wealth. 5,000 merchants met in its Bourse, or
Exchange, every week. It was then the Venice of the North, with about
125,000 inhabitants.</p>

Flanders about this time.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_large_s.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SINCE my hap was to be present at so
piteous a spectacle as the Sacking and
Spoil of Antwerp, a lamentable example
which hath already filled all Europe with
dreadful news of great calamity, I have
thought good, for the benefit of my
country, to publish a true report thereof.
The which may as well serve for profitable
example unto all estates of such condition[s] as suffered in the
same: as also answer all honest expectations with a mean
truth set down between the extreme surmises of sundry
doubtful minds; and increased by the manifold light tales
which have been engendered by fearful or affectionate
[<i>prejudiced</i>] rehearsals.</p>

<p>And therewithal if the wickedness used in the said town
do seem unto the well disposed Reader, a sufficient cause of
GOD's so just a scourge and plague; and yet the fury of the
vanquishers do also seem more barbarous and cruel than may
become a good Christian conqueror: let these my few words
become a forewarning on both hands; and let them stand as
a lantern of light between two perilous rocks; that both
amending the one, and detesting the other, we may gather
fire out of the flint and honey out of the thistle.</p>

<p>To that end, all stories and Chronicles are written; and
to that end I presume to publish this Pamphlet; protesting
that neither malice to the one side, nor partial affection to
the other, shall make my pen to swerve any iote [<i>jot</i> or <i>iota</i>]
from truth of that which I will set down, and saw executed.</p>

<p>For if I were disposed to write maliciously against the
vanquishers: their former barbarous cruelty, insolences, rapes,
spoils, incests, and sacrileges committed in sundry other
places, might yield me sufficient matter without the lawful
remembrance of this their late Stratagem. Or if I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
undertake to move a general compassion by blazing abroad
the miseries and calamities of the vanquished: their long
sustained injuries and yokes of untollerable bondage, their
continual broils in war, their doubtful dreads in peace, their
accusations without cause, and condemnations without proof,
might enable a dumb stone to talk of their troubles, and
fetch brinish tears out of the most craggy rock to lament and
bewail the burning houses of so near neighbours.</p>

<p>But as I said before, mine only intent is to set down a
plain truth, for the satisfying of such as have hitherto been
carried about with doubtful reports; and for a profitable
example unto all such as, being subject to like imperfections,
might fall thereby into the like calamities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And to make the matter more perspicuous; I must derive
the beginning of this Discourse a little beyond the beginning
of the Massacre: that the cause being partially opened, the
effect may be the more plainly seen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is then to be understood that the Sacking and Spoil of
Antwerp hath been, by all likelihood, long pretended
[<i>designed</i>] by the Spaniards: and that they have done
nothing else but lie in wait continually, to find any least
quarrel to put the same in execution. For proof whereof,
their notable Rebellion and Mutiny began in the same [city,
on 26th April 1574]; when their watch-word was <i>Fuora
villiacco</i>! [This is apparently old Spanish for <i>Out with the
townsfolk!</i>] might sufficiently bewray their malicious and
cruel intent. And though it were then smoothly coloured
over [<i>explained away</i>] and subtilly appeased by the crafty
devisers of the same: yet the coals of the choler, being but
raked up in the embers of false semblance, have now found
out the wicked winds of wiliness and wrath; which meeting
together have kindled such a flame as gave open way to their
detestable devices.</p>

<p>For the Estates of the Low Countries, being over-wearied
with the intolerable burden of their tyrannies; and having
taken arms to withstand their malice and rebellious mutinies:
the town of Antwerp, being left open and subject unto the
Citadel, did yet remain quiet; and entered not into any
martial action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereat the Spaniards (being much moved; and having
not yet opportunity to work their will so colourably [<i>with a
sufficient pretence</i>] as they wished) bestowed certain cannon
shot out of the said Castle, and slew certain innocent souls;
with some other small harm and damage done to the edifices:
thinking thereby to harden the hearts of the poor Flemings,
and to make them take arms for their just defence; whiles
they thereby might take occasion to execute their unjust
pretence. And this was done on the 19th, or 20th, of October
[1576] last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now to answer all objections; I doubt not but it will be
alleged that the Castle bestowed the said cannon shot at the
town; because they of the town did not shoot at the Prince
of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>'s ships, which lay within sight thereof: but alas
it is easy to find a staff when a man would beat a dog.</p>

<p>For the truth is, that those ships did no greater hurt either
to the town or Castle than friendly to waft up [<i>convoy</i>] all
manner of grain and victuals for the sustenance of the said
town: which even then began to want such provisions by
reason that the said Spaniards had built a Fort on [the]
Flanders side upon the same river [<i>the Scheldt</i>]; and thereby
stopped all such as brought victual to the said town; burning
and destroying the country near adjoining, and using all
terror to the poor people, to the intent that Antwerp might
lack provision[s].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And about the same time also, the Spaniards cut off a
bridge, which was the open passage between Antwerp and
Machlen [<i>Malines</i>], at a village called Walem [<i>Waelhem</i>], a
manifest proof of their plain intent to distress the said town,
and to shut up the same from the rest of Brabant: since they
were walled in with the river on the one side; and on that
other the Spanish horsemen occupied all the country, and so
terrified the poor people as they durst not bring their
commodities to the same.</p>

<p>All this notwithstanding, the chief rulers of the said town
of Antwerp appeased the people; and put up [with] these
injuries until they might be better able to redress them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after, the Spaniards, assisted by the treason of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
High Duches [<i>Germans</i>], entered the town of Maestricht
upon a sudden; and put the same to sack: killing and
destroying great numbers of innocent people therein. A
thing to be noted. For that Maestricht had never revolted;
but stood quiet under their garrisons, as faithful subjects to
their King [<span class="smcap">Philip</span> II]: and the one half thereof pertained
also unto the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Liege</span>, who had yet meddled nothing
at all in these actions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The chief rulers and people of Antwerp (perceiving thereby
the cruel intent of the Spaniards; and doubting [<i>fearing</i>]
their Duche [<i>German</i>] garrison, which was of the Count
<span class="smcap">Oberstein</span>'s Regiment, as they were also which betrayed
Maestricht) began to abandon the town, leaving their houses
and goods behind them; and sought to withdraw themselves
into some place of safer abode.</p>

<p>Whereat the Estates, being moved with compassion, and
doubting that the town would shortly be left desolate, levied
a Power of 3,000 Footmen and 800 or 1,000 Horsemen
[<i>mostly Walloons and Germans</i>]; and sent the same, under
the conduct of the Marquis <span class="smcap">D'Havr&eacute;</span>, the young Count
<span class="smcap">[Philip] d'Egmont</span>, Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Capres</span>, Monsieur <span class="smcap">de
Berselle</span> [or <span class="smcap">Berselen</span>], Monsieur <i>de Gogines</i>, and other
Nobles and Gentlemen, to succour and defend the town of Antwerp
against the cruel pretence [<i>designs</i>] of the said Spaniards.</p>

<p>And they came before the Gates thereof, on Friday the
2nd of this instant [November 1576], at a Port on the east
or south-east side thereof, called Kipdorp Port. Whereat
the Spaniards, being enraged, discharged sundry shot of
great artillery from the Castle; but to small purpose.</p>

<p>At last, Monsieur [<span class="smcap">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Perrenot</span>, Sieur] <span class="smcap">de
Champagney</span>, who was Governor of the town, and the Count
<span class="smcap">Oberstein</span>, which was Colonel of the garrison, demanded
of the States' [troops], Wherefore they approached the town
in such order?</p>

<p>Who answered, That they came to enter the same as
friends, and to entrench and defend it from the Spaniards:
protesting further, That they would offer no manner of
violent damage or injury to the persons or goods of any such
as inhabited the same.</p>

<p>Hereupon the said Monsieur [the Sieur] <span class="smcap">de Champagney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></span>
and Count <span class="smcap">Oberstein</span> went out unto them, and conferred
more privately together by the space of one hour: and
returned into the town, leaving the Estates' Power at a
village called Borgherhout.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the morrow, being the 3rd of this instant [November
1576], they were permitted to enter, and came into the town:
21 Ensigns of Footmen and 6 Cornets of Horsemen.</p>

<p>Immediately after their entry, the inhabitants brought
them sacks of wool and other such provision; wherewith
they approached the Yard or plain ground which lieth before
the Castle: and, placing the same at the ends of five streets
which lie open unto the said Castle Yard [<i>Esplanade</i>],
entrenched under them with such expedition that in less
than five hours those streets' ends were all reasonably well
fortified from the Castle, for any sudden [attack].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time and twelve days before [<i>i.e. from 22nd
October</i> 1576], I was in the said town of Antwerp, upon
certain private affairs of mine own; so that I was enforced
to become an eyed-witness [see page <a href="#Page_142">142</a>] of their Entry [<i>i.e.
of the States' troops</i>] and all that they did: as also afterwards&mdash;for
all the Gates were kept fast shut, and I could not
depart&mdash;to behold the pitiful Stratagem which followed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Castle thundered with shot at the town: but it was a
very misty day; so that they could neither find their marks
very well, not yet see how the streets' ends were entrenched.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing to see the willingness of the inhabitants,
and how soon many hands had despatched a
very great piece of work. For, before midnight, they had
made the trenches as high as the length of a pike; and
had begun one trench for a Counterskarf [<i>Counterscarp</i>]
between all those streets and the Castle Yard: the which
they perfected unto the half way from St George's Churchyard
unto the water's side by St Michael's; and there
left from work, meaning to have perfected it the next
day.</p>

<p>That Counterscarf had been to much purpose, if it had
been finished: as shall appear by a Model [<i>Plan</i>] of the
whole place which I have annexed to this treaty [<i>treatise</i>]; by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
view whereof the skillful Reader may plainly perceive the
execution of every particularity.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These things thus begun and set in forwardness; it is
to be noted that the Spaniards (having intelligence of the
States' Power, when it set forward from Brussels; and perceiving
that it bent towards Antwerp) had sent to Maestricht,
Lierre, and Alost to draw all the Power that could be
made, unto the Castle of Antwerp. So that on Sunday, the
4th of this instant [November 1576], in the morning, they all
met at the said Castle. And their Powers, as far as I could
gather, were these:</p>

<p>There came from Maestricht, very near to 1,000 Horsemen,
led by <span class="smcap">Alonzo de Vargas</span> who is the General of the
Horsemen; and 500 Footmen or more, governed by the
Camp Master, <span class="smcap">Francesco de Valdez</span>.</p>

<p>There came from Lierre, 500 Footmen or more, governed
by the Camp Master, <span class="smcap">Juliano de Romero</span>.</p>

<p>There came from Alost, 2,000 Footmen, which were the
same that rebelled for their pay and other unreasonable
demands, immediately after the Winning of Zierikzee [<i><span class="smcap">J. de
Rodas</span>, at page <a href="#Page_168">168</a>, states that these 2,000 soldiers were</i>
"desperate men."] These had none other conductor than
their <i>Electo</i> [or <i>Eletto, i.e., their elected Chief; at this time a
man named <span class="smcap">Navarette</span></i>], after the manner of such as mutiny
and rebel: but were of sundry Companies, as Don
<span class="smcap">Emanuel</span>'s, and others. Nevertheless I have been so bold
in the Model [<i>Plan</i>] as to set down the said Don <span class="smcap">Emanuel</span>,
for their leader: both because I think that, their mutiny
notwithstanding, he led them at the exploit; and also
because he was slain amongst them at their entry.</p>

<p>Thus the number of [the] Spaniards was 4,000 or thereabouts;
besides some help that they had of the garrison
within the Castle. And besides, 1,000 High Almains
[<i>Germans</i>] or more; which came from Maestricht, Lierre, and
those parts. And they were of three sundry Regiments:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Fugger</span>'s, <span class="smcap">Polwiller</span>'s, and <span class="smcap">Frondsberger</span>'s:
but they were led all by <span class="smcap">Charles Fugger</span>. So that the
whole force of the Spaniards and their complices was
5,000 and upwards.</p>

<p>The which assembled and met at the Castle, on the said
4th day [of November 1576], about ten of the clock before
dinner: and, as I have heard credibly reported, would
neither stay to refresh themselves, having marched all night
and the day before; nor yet to confer of anything but only
of the order how they should issue and assail: protesting
and vowing neither to eat nor drink until they might eat and
drink at liberty and pleasure in Antwerp: the which vow
they performed, contrary to all men's reason and expectation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Their order of entry into the Castle Yard [<i>Esplanade</i>], and
their approach to the trenches I did not see: for I could not
get out of the town; neither did I think it reasonable to be
<i>Hospes in aliena republica curiosus</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, as I heard it rehearsed by sundry of themselves, I
will also here rehearse it for a truth:</p>

<p>The Horsemen and Footmen which came from Maestricht
and Lierre, came through a village on the east side of
the town called Borgerhout about ten of the clock before
noon, as beforesaid. The Governor and Estates, being
thereof advertised, sent out presently part of their Horsemen
and Footmen to discover and take knowledge of them. But
before they could issue out of the Gates, the Spaniards were
passed on the south-east side of the town ditch, and entered
at a Gate which standeth on the Counterscarf of the Castle
Yard [<i>Esplanade</i>], called the Windmill Port. There
entered the Horsemen and all the Footmen; saving the
High Almains [<i>Germans</i>] who marched round about the
Castle, by a village called Kiel; and, trailing their pikes
on the ground after them, came in at a small Postern on
the Brayes by the river, and on the west side of the Castle.</p>

<p>Those which came from Alost, came through the said
village called Kiel, and so, through the Castle, [and] issued
out of the same at the Fore Gate, which standeth towards
the town.</p>

<p>Being thus passed, and entered into the Castle Yard,
about eleven of the clock; they of Alost and of the Castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
cast themselves into four Squadrons; they of Maestricht and
Lierre into two Squadrons, and their Horsemen into a Troop
behind them; and the High Almains [<i>Germans</i>] into a
Squadron or Battalion by the river's side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being thus ordered, and appointment given where every
Squadron should charge and endure; they cast off certain
Loose Shot [<i>Skirmishers</i>] from every Squadron, and attacked
the Scarmouch [? <i>Piquet</i>]. The which continued not one
hour; before they drew their Squadrons so near unto the
Counterscarf and Trenches, that they brake and charged
<i>pell mell</i>.</p>

<p>The Castle had, all this while, played at the town and
trenches with thundering shot: but now, upon a signal given,
ceased to shoot any more, for fear to hurt their own men;
wherein I noted their good order, which wanted no direction,
in their greatest fury.</p>

<p>The Walloons and Almains [<i>Germans</i>] which served in the
Trenches, defended all this while very stoutly. And the
Spaniards with their Almains continued the charge with
such valour, that in fine they won the Counterscarf, and
presently scaled the Trenches with great fury. The
Walloons and Almains, having long resisted without any
fresh relief or supply, many of them in this meanwhile
being slain and hurt, were not able any longer to repulse the
Spaniards: so that they entered the Trenches about twelve
of the clock, and presently pursued their victory down every
street.</p>

<p>In their chase, as fast as they gained any cross street, they
flanked the same with their Musquet[eer]s until they saw no
longer resistance of any Power; and they proceeded in
chase, executing all such as they overtook. In this good
order they charged and entered; in this good order they
proceeded; and in as good order, their lackays and pages
followed with firebrands and wild fire, setting the houses on
fire in every place where their masters had entered.</p>

<p>The Walloons and Almains which were to defend the
town [<i>being chiefly those commanded by the Marquis d'<span class="smcap">Havr&eacute;</span></i>]
being grown into some security by reason that their Trenches
were so high as seemed invincible; and, lacking sufficient
generals or directors, were found as far out of order as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Spaniards were to be honoured for the good order and direction
which they kept.</p>

<p>For those which came to supply and relieve the Trenches
came straggling and loose. Some came from the furthest
side of the town. Some, that were nearer, came very
fearfully! and many, out of their lodgings, from drinking
and carousing; who would scarcely believe that any
conflict was begun, when the Spaniards now met them in
the streets to put them out of doubt that they dallied
not.</p>

<p>To conclude, their carelessness and lack of foresight was
such that they never had a <i>Corps du Gard</i> [Block House] to
supply and relieve their Trenches; but only one in the
Market Place of the town, which was a good quarter of a
mile from their fortifications: and that also was of Almains
[<i>Germans commanded by that double-dyed traitor <span class="smcap">Cornelis</span>
<span class="smcap">Van Einden</span>, or <span class="smcap">Van Ende</span></i>]; who, when they spied the
Spaniards, did gently kneel down, letting their pikes fall,
and crying, <i>O liebe Spaniarden! O liebe Spaniarden!</i> ["O
dear Spaniards!" <i>That is, <span class="smcap">Van Einden</span> traitorously joined
with the invading Spaniards.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now I have set down the order of their entry, approach,
charge, and assault, together with their proceeding in victory;
and that by credible report, both of the Spaniards themselves
and of others who served in their company: let me
also say a little of that which I saw executed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was lodged in the English House, <i>ut supra</i>: and had
not gone abroad that morning by reason of weighty business
which I had in hand the same day. At dinner time [<i>which
was then about 11 a.m.</i>], the Merchantmen of my country,
which came out of the town and dined in my chamber,
told me, That a hot scarmouch [<i>skirmish</i>] was begun in
the Castle Yard, and that the fury thereof still increased.
About the midst of dinner, news came, That the shot was
so thick, as neither ground, houses, nor people could be
discerned for the smoke thereof: and before dinner were
fully ended, That the Spaniards were like[ly] to win the
Trenches.</p>

<p>Whereat I stept from the table, and went hastily up into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
a high tower of the said English House: from whence I
might discover fire in four or five places of the town
towards the Castle Yard; and thereby I was well assured
that the Spaniards indeed were entered within the Trenches.</p>

<p>So that I came down, and took my cloak and sword, to
see the certainty thereof: and as I passed towards the Bourse
[<i>Exchange</i>] I met many; but I overtook none. And those
which I met were no townsmen, but soldiers: nether walked
they as men which use traffic, but ran as men which are in
fear.</p>

<p>Whereat, being somewhat grieved, and seeing the townsmen
stand every man before his door with such weapons
as they had; I demanded of one of them, What it meant?</p>

<p>Who answered me in these words, <i>Helas, Monsieur, il
n'y a point d'ordre; et voil&agrave; la ruine de cette ville!</i> [Alas,
Sir, there is no order; and behold the ruin of this
town!]</p>

<p><i>Ayez courage, mon ami!</i> [Have courage, my friend!],
quoth I; and so went onwards yet towards the Bourse:
meeting all the way more and more [of those] which mended
their pace.</p>

<p>At last, a Walloon Trumpeter on horseback, who seemed
to be but a boy of years, drew his sword, and laid about
him, crying <i>O&ugrave; est ce que vous enfuyez, canaille? Faisons
t&ecirc;te, pour l'honeur de la patrie!</i> [Where are you flying to,
rascals? Make head, for the honour of our country!]
Wherewith fifty or threescore of them turned head, and
went backwards towards the Bourse.</p>

<p>The which encouraged me, <i>par compagnie</i>, to proceed.</p>

<p>But alas, this comfort endured but a while. For by that
time I came on the farther side of the Bourse, I might
see a great troop coming in greater haste, with their heads
as close together as a school of young fry or a flock of
sheep; who met me, on the farther side of the Bourse,
towards the Market Place: and, having their leaders foremost
(for I knew them by their javelins, boar spears, and
staves), [they] bare me over backwards; and ran over my
belly and my face, [a] long time before I could recover on
foot.</p>

<p>At last, when I was up, I looked on every side, and
seeing them run so fast, began thus to bethink me, "What,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in God's name, do I hear? which have no interest in
this action; since they who came to defend this town
are content to leave it at large, and shift for themselves."</p>

<p>And whilst I stood thus musing, another flock of
flyers came so fast that they bare me on my nose, and
ran as many over my back, as erst had marched over my
stomach. In fine, I got up like a tall fellow; and went
with them for company: but their haste was such as I
could never overtake them until I came at a broad cross
street, which lieth between the English House and the
said Bourse.</p>

<p>There I overtook some of them grovelling on the
ground, and groaning for the last gasp; and some others
which turned backwards to avoid the tickling of the
Spanish Musquets [<i>Musketeers</i>]: who had gotten the ends
of the said broad cross street, and flanked it both ways.
And there I stayed a while till, hearing the shot increase
and fearing to be surprised with such as might follow
in tail of us; I gave adventure to pass through the said
cross street: and, without vaunt be it spoken, passed
through five hundred shots before I could recover the
English House.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At my coming thither, I found many of the Merchants
standing before the gate: whom I would not discomfort
nor dismay but said, That the Spaniards had
once entered the town, and that I hoped they were gone
back again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I went to the Governor: and privily persuaded
him to draw in the company; and to shut up the
gates.</p>

<p>The which he consented unto: and desired me, because
I was somewhat better acquainted with such matters than
the Merchants, to take charge of the key.</p>

<p>I took it willingly, but before I could well shut and bar
the gate, the Spaniards were now come forwards into the
same street; and passing by the door, called to come
in; bestowing five or six musquet shot at the gate,
where I answered them; whereof one came very near my
nose, and piercing through the gate, strake one of the
Merchants on the head, without any great or dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hurt. But the heat of the pursuit was yet such, that
they could not attend the spoil; but passed on in
chase to the New Town, where they slew infinite
numbers of people: and, by three of the clock, or before,
returned victors; having slain, or put to flight, all their
enemies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, to keep promise and to speak without partiality,
I must needs confess that it was the greatest
victory, and the roundliest executed, that hath been seen,
read, or heard of, in our Age: and that it was a thing
miraculous to consider how Trenches of such a height
should be entered, passed over, and won, both by Footmen
and Horsemen.</p>

<p>For immediately after that the Footmen were gotten
in, the Horsemen found means to follow: and being, many
of them, Harquebussiers on horseback, did pass by their
own Footmen in the streets; and much hastened both the
flight of the Walloons, and made the way opener unto
speedy executioners.</p>

<p>But whosoever will therein most extoll the Spaniards
for their valour and order, must therewith confess that
it was the very ordinance of GOD for a just plague
and scourge unto the town. For otherwise it passeth
all men's capacity to conceive how it should be possible.</p>

<p>And yet the disorder and lack of foresight in the
Walloons did great[ly] help to augment the Spanish glory
and boast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To conclude. The Count <span class="smcap">d'Oberstein</span> was drowned
in the New Town. The Marquis <span class="smcap">d'Havr&eacute;</span> and [Sieur
<span class="smcap">de</span>] <span class="smcap">Champagney</span> escaped out of the said New Town, and
recovered the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>'s ships.</p>

<p>Only the young Count [<span class="smcap">Philip</span>] of <span class="smcap">Egmont</span> was taken,
fighting by St Michael's. Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Capres</span> and
Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Gogines</span> were also taken. But I heard
of none that fought stoutly, saving only the said Count
of <span class="smcap">Egmont</span>; whom the Colonel <span class="smcap">Verdugo</span>, a Spaniard
of an honourable compassion and good mind, did
save: with great danger to himself in defending the
Count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>In this conflict there were slain 600 Spaniards, or
thereabouts. And on the Thursday next following [8th
November 1576], a view of the dead bodies in the town
being taken, it was esteemed at 17,000 men, women, and
children. [<i>This would be apart from those drowned in
the Scheldt.</i>] A pitiful massacre, though GOD gave victory
to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>And surely, as their valiance was to be much commended;
so yet I can much discommend their barbarous
cruelty in many respects. For methinks that as when
GOD giveth abundance of wealth, the owner ought yet
to have regard on whom he bestow it: even so, when
GOD giveth a great and miraculous victory, the conquerors
ought to have great regard unto their execution.
And though some, which favour the Spanish faction, will
alledge sundry reasons to the contrary: yet, when the blood
is cold and the fury over, methinks that a true Christian
heart should stand content with victory; and refrain to
provoke GOD's wrath by [the] shedding of innocent
blood.</p>

<p>These things I rehearse the rather, because they
neither spared <i>Age nor Sex, Time nor Place, Person nor
Country, Profession nor Religion, Young nor Old, Rich
nor Poor, Strong nor Feeble</i>: but, without any mercy, did
tyrannously triumph, when there was neither man nor
means to resist them.</p>

<p>For <i>Age and Sex, Young and Old</i>; they slew great
numbers of young children; but many more women more
than four score years of age.</p>

<p>For <i>Time and Place</i>; their fury was as great ten days
after the victory, as at the time of their entry; and
as great respect they had to the Church and Churchyard,
for all their hypocritical boasting of the Catholic
Religion, as the butcher had to his shambles or slaughter
house.</p>

<p>For <i>Person and Country</i>, they spared neither friend nor
foe, Portugese nor Turk.</p>

<p>For <i>Profession and Religion</i>, the Jesuits must give
their ready coin; and all other Religious Houses, both
coin and plate: with all short ends that were good and
portable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Rich</i> was spoiled because he had; and the <i>Poor</i>
were hanged because they had nothing. Neither <i>Strength</i>
could prevail to make resistance, nor <i>Weakness</i> move pity
for to refrain their horrible cruelty.</p>

<p>And this was not only done when the chase was hot;
but, as I erst said, when the blood was cold; and they
[were] now victors without resistance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I refrain to rehearse the heaps of dead carcases which
lay at every Trench where they entered; the thickness
whereof did in many places exceed the height of a
man.</p>

<p>I forbear also to recount the huge numbers drowned
in the New Town: where a man might behold as many
sundry shapes and forms of man's motion at [the] time
of death as ever <span class="smcap">Michael Angelo</span> did portray in
his Tables of Doomsday [<i>Picture of the Last Judgment</i>].</p>

<p>I list not to reckon the infinite number of poor Almains
[<i>Germans</i>], who lay burned in their armour. Some [with]
the entrails scorched out, and all the rest of the body
free. Some [with] their head and shoulders burnt off;
so that you might look down into the bulk and breast,
and there take an anatomy of the secrets of Nature.
Some [were] standing upon their waist; being burnt off
by the thighs. And some no more but the very top of
the brain taken off with fire; whiles the rest of the body
did abide unspeakable torments.</p>

<p>I set not down the ugly and filthy polluting of every
street with the gore and carcases of horses; neither do
I complain that the one lacked burial, and the other flaying,
until the air, corrupted with their carion, infected all that
yet remained alive in the town.</p>

<p>And why should I describe the particularity of every
such annoyance as commonly happens both in camps and
castles where martial feats are managed?</p>

<p>But I may not pass over with silence the wilful burning
and destroying of the stately Town House, and all the
muniments and records of the city: neither can I refrain
to tell their shameful rapes and outrageous forces presented
unto sundry honest dames and virgins.</p>

<p>It is also a ruthful remembrance, that a poor English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Merchant, who was but a servant, having once redeemed
his master's goods for 300 crowns, was yet hanged until
he were half dead, because he had not 200 more to give
them. And the halter being cut down, and he come to
himself again; [he] besought them on knees, with bitter
tears, to give him leave to seek and try his credit and
friends in the town, for the rest of their unreasonable
demand. At his return, because he sped not, as indeed no
money was then to be had, they hung him again outright:
and afterwards, of exceeding courtesy, procured the Friars
Minor to bury him.</p>

<p>To conclude. Of the 17,000 carcases which were viewed
on the Thursday: I think, in conscience, 5,000, or few
less, were massacred after their victory; because they
had not ready money wherewith to ransom their goods
at such prices as they pleased to set on them. At least,
all the World will bear me witness, that ten days after,
whosoever was but pointed at, and named to be a Walloon,
was immediately massacred without further audience or
trial.</p>

<p>For mine own part, it is well known that I did often
escape very narrowly; because I was taken for a Walloon.
And on Sunday, the 11th of this instant [November 1576],
which was the day before I gat out of the town, I saw three
poor souls murdered in my presence, because they were
pointed [at] to be Walloons: and it was well proved,
immediately [after], that one of them was a poor artificer,
who had dwelt in the town eight years before, and [had]
never managed arms, but truly followed his occupation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the seed of these and other barbarous facts
brought forth this crop and fruit, That, within three days,
Antwerp, which was one of the richest towns in Europe,
had now no money nor treasure to be found therein, but only
in the hands of murderers and strumpets. For every Don
DIEGO must walk, jetting up and down the streets, with
his harlot by him, in her chain and bracelets of gold.
And the notable Bourse, which was wont to be a safe
assembly for merchants and men of all honest trades, had
now none other merchandise therein but as many dicing
tables as might be placed round about it, all the day long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Men will boast of the Spaniards, that they are the best
and most orderly soldiers in the World: but, sure[ly], if
this be their order, I had rather be accounted a <i>Besoigner</i>
[French for <i>an indigent beggar</i>] than a brave soldier in
such a Band: neither must we think, although it hath
pleased GOD (for some secret cause only known to his
divine Majesty) to yield Antwerp and Maestricht thus into
their hands; that he will spare to punish this their
outrageous cruelty, when his good will and pleasure shall
be to do the same. For surely their boasting and bragging
of iniquity is over great to escape long unscourged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have talked with sundry of them; and demanded, Why
they would command that the Town House should be
burned?</p>

<p>And their answer was, Because it was the place of
assembly where all evil counsels were contrived.</p>

<p>As though it were just that the stocks and stones should
suffer for the offence of men. But such is their obstinate
mind and arrogancy that, if they might have their will, they
would altogether raze and destroy the towns, until no one
stone were left upon another. Neither doth their stubborn
blindness suffer them to perceive that in so doing they
should much endamage the King their Master; whom they
boast so faithfully to honour, serve, and obey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As for the injuries done by them unto our own Nation
particularly; I will thus set down as much as I know.</p>

<p>We were quiet in the House appointed for the Mansion
of English Merchants, under safe Conduct, Protection, and
Placard [<i>Placcaet=Proclamation</i>] of their King: having
neither meddled any way in these actions; nor by any
means assisted the Estates of the country with money,
munition, or any kind of aid. Yea, the Governor [<span class="smcap">Thomas
Heton</span>] and Merchants, foreseeing the danger of the time,
had often demanded passport[s] of the King's Governors
and Officers to depart.</p>

<p>And all these, with sundry other allegations, we
propounded and protested unto them before they entered
the English House; desiring to be there protected, according
to our Privileges and Grants from the King their Master;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and that they would suffer us there to remain, free from
all outrage spoil or ransom, until we might make our estate
known unto [<span class="smcap">Sancho d'Avila</span>] the Castellan [of Antwerp
Castle] and other Head Officers which served there for the
said King.</p>

<p>All which notwithstanding; they threatened to fire the
House unless we would open the doors: and, being once
suffered to enter, demanded presently the ransom of 12,000
crowns of the Governor. Which sum, being not indeed in
the House, neither yet one-third part of the same; they
spared not with naked swords and daggers to menace the
Governor, and violently to present him death; because
he had not wherewith to content their greedy minds.</p>

<p>I will not boast of any help afforded by me in that
distress: but I thank the Lord GOD! who made me an
instrument to appease their devilish furies. And I think
that the Governor and all the Company will confess that I
used mine uttermost skill and aid for the safeguard of their
lives, as well as [of] mine own.</p>

<p>But in the end, all eloquence notwithstanding; the
Governor [<span class="smcap">Thomas Heton</span>], being a comely aged man
and a person whose hoary hairs might move pity and
procure reverence in any good mind; especially the uprightness
of his dealing considered: they enforced him, with
great danger, to bring forth all the money, plate, and jewels
which were in the House; and to prepare the remnant of
12,000 crowns at such days and times as they pleased to
appoint.</p>

<p>And of the rest of our Nation, which had their goods
remaining in their several pack-houses and lodgings elsewhere
in the town; they took such pity that four they slew,
and divers others they most cruelly and dangerously hurt:
spoiling and ransoming them to the uttermost value that
might be made, or esteemed, of all their goods. Yea, a
certain one, they enforced to ransom his goods twice; yea,
thrice: and, all that notwithstanding, took the said goods
violently from them at the last.</p>

<p>And all these injuries being opened unto their chief
Governors in time convenient; and whiles yet the whole
sum, set for [the] several ransoms of our countrymen and
the English House in general, were not half paid; so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
justice and good order might partly have qualified the
former rigours proferred by the soldiers: the said Governors
were as slow and deaf, as the others were quick and light,
of hearing to find the bottom of every bag in the town.
So that it seemeth they were fully agreed in all things:
or, if any contention were, the same was but [a] strife who,
or which, of them might do greatest wrongs. Keeping the
said Governor and Merchants there still, without grant of
passport or safe conduct, when there are scarcely any
victuals to be had for any money in the town; nor yet
the said Merchants have any money to buy it, where it is.
And as for credit; neither credit nor pawn can now find coin
in Antwerp.</p>

<p>In these distresses, I left them the 12th of this instant
November 1576; when I parted from them: not as one who
was hasty to leave and abandon them in such misery; but
to solicit their rueful causes here, and to deliver the same
unto Her Majesty and [the Privy] Council in such sort as I
beheld it there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this is, in effect, the whole truth of the Sacking and
Spoil of so famous a town. Wherein is to be noted&mdash;that
the Spaniards and their faction being but 5,000; the
Trenches made against them of such height as seemed
invincible; the Power within the town, 15,000 or 16,000
able fighting men well armed, I mean the townsmen ready
armed being counted: it was charged, entered, and won in
three hours; and before six hours passed over, every house
therein sacked, or ransomed at the uttermost value.</p>

<p>The which victory (being miraculous and past man's capacity
to comprehend how it should be possible) I must needs
attribute unto GOD's just wrath poured upon the inhabitants
for their iniquity, more than to the manhood and force of the
Spaniards. And yet I mean not to rob them of their
deserved glory; but to confess that both their order and
valour in charging and entering was famous: and had they
kept half so good order, or shewed the tenth part of such
manly courage, in using their victory and parting of their
spoil; I must then needs have said that <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> had never
any such soldiers. And this must I needs say for them that,
as their continual training in service doth make them expert

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

in all warlike stratagem[s]; so their daily trade in spoiling
hath made them the cunningest ransackers of houses, and
the best able to bring a spoil unto a quick market, of any
soldiers or master thieves that ever I heard of.</p>

<p>But I leave the scanning of their deeds unto GOD,
who will bridle their insolency when he thinketh good and
convenient. And let us also learn, out of this rueful tragedy,
to detest and avoid those sins and proud enormities which
caused the wrath of GOD to be so furiously kindled and
bent against the town of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Let us also, if ever we should be driven to like occasion,
which GOD forbid! learn to look better about us for good
order and direction; the lack whereof was their overthrow.
For surely the inhabitants lacked but good guides and
leaders: for (having none other order appointed, but to
stand every man armed in readiness before his door) they
died there, many of them, fighting manfully; when the
Wallooners and High Duches [<i>Germans</i>] fled beastly.</p>

<p>Let us also learn to detest the horrible cruelties of the
Spaniards, in all executions of warlike stratagems; lest the
dishonour of such beastly deeds might bedim the honour
wherewith English soldiers have always been endowed in
their victories.</p>

<p>And finally let us pray to GOD for grace to amend our
lives, and for power and foresight to withstand the malice of
our enemies: that remaining and continuing in the peaceable
protection of our most gracious Sovereign, we may give
Him the glory; and all due and loyal obedience unto Her
Majesty, whom GOD now and ever prospect and preserve.
Amen.</p>

From Antwerp, 10 November 1576.</h4>

<p>Right Honourable, the 3rd of this month the States'
men, Horsemen and Footmen, entered this town with
consent: and on the morrow, which was Sunday the 4th of
this present, the Spaniards with certain Almains, out of the
Castle, entered the town and drave away the States' Power
and they fled as they could: the town [being] put to sack,
with a pitiful slaughter and a miserable spoil.</p>

<p>Our House [was] entered by Twelve Spaniards, soldiers,
who put me and the rest of the Company in great fear.
We were put to ransom first at 12,000 crowns; and since it
is grown one way and [an]other to 3,000 more: and what
the Company have lost, that had their chambers and pack-houses
in the town in burghers' houses, at this present,
I know not; but they are spoiled of all.</p>

<p>In the name of the Company there is a letter written
to the honourable [Privy] Council of our state [<i>See next
document</i>] most humbly beseeching that their Honours
would be a mean[s] for us to Her Majesty, as to their
Honours in this case they shall think good.</p>

<p>If we might have had passport[s] when I required it,
first of the States, then of Monsieur [<span class="smcap">DE</span>] <span class="smcap">Champagney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></span>
Governor of this town, and after of the Lords of this town,
as both by the Intercourse [of 1507] and Privileges we ought
in right to have had; then had we avoided this great peril
of life and miserable spoil which we have sustained.</p>

<p>And now I most humbly beseech you to move my good
Lords that some [persons and money] may be sent over for
our comfort, that we may be permitted to pass out of this
town in person, and [also] such goods as we have
remaining. For in this town we shall lack both victuals and
fuel; and also be daily in fear of the like spoil that we have
sustained.</p>

<p>And thus, what for the great peril that I have sustained,
and the burden and charge of my Office; I must crave
pardon though my writing be not as it should be.</p>

<p>I do perceive they [<i>the Spaniards</i>] stand here in doubt
how Her Majesty will take this doing to us.</p>

<p>The Lord send me and my wife into England, if it be his
good will.</p>

From Antwerp, [10] November 1576.</h4>

<p>Right Honourable our good and gracious Lords, &amp;c.
In all humbleness these are showing to your Honours
that in respect of the troubles all over this country, and
especially the danger in this town of Antwerp; such of
our Society as are here remaining did purpose, and some
attempted, to have, in due time, removed from this place
both their persons and goods; some by water and some
by land, as well towards England as for Duchland [<i>Germany</i>.]
And being letted [<i>hindered</i>] of their purpose and attempts
both the ways, and not suffered to pass their goods out
of this town; whereupon [they] sought to have had free
passage and passport here, according to the Intercourse
and Safe Conduct.</p>

<p>But after many delays, from time to time; the 3rd day
of this month, our requests were plainly denied, either
to be granted, or by writing answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>So as, the 4th day, we are fallen into great peril of our
lives; divers of our Company being hurt, and some slain.
And by sacking of this town ever since, we are not only
spoiled of our money and goods that were in private houses
thereof; but also we are further forced, for ransom and
safeguard of our persons and goods within the principal
House of our residence here, to answer and content the
Spanish soldiers and others who, in the Fury, entered our
said House, accounting charges, above the sum of &pound;5,000
Flemish.</p>

<p>Towards furniture [<i>furnishing</i>] whereof, we have been
constrained to give them all the money and plate that was
in our said House; and also to use our credit for so much
as we could get besides. And yet all accounted and
delivered to them doth not discharge the one half of the
sum; and for the rest we have given them Bills payable
at a month, and some part at two months: so as now we
have not money to provide for our needful sustentation.</p>

<p>Wherefore we most humbly beseech your good Lordships
and Honours, of your accustomed clemencies, to have
compassion upon us; and to be means to our most gracious
Sovereign Lady, the Queen's Majesty, that speedy order
may be given for our relief, and release out of this place:
where presently [<i>at present</i>] we are void of money and
credit; and shortly are like[ly] to be void of sustenance,
and not able to get it for money.</p>

<p>The discourse of these tragedies we omit, and refer the
same to be reported to your Lordships by this bringer,
Master <span class="smcap">George Gascon</span>; whose humanity, in this time of
trouble, we, for our parts, have experimented.</p>

<p>And so leaving the further and due consideration of our
case unto your Right Honourable wisdoms and clemencies;
we beseech Almighty GOD to preserve your good Lordships
and Honours in long health and felicity.</p>

was published in London, under the title, <i>A larum for London, or

<p>8. Five days after <span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span> got out of Antwerp; the English
Ambassador was there. No doubt he helped our Merchant Adventurers
in their dire extremity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeronimo de Rodas</span>, or <span class="smcap">Roda</span>, was the supreme villain in
command of the troops that had sacked the town; as <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>
<span class="smcap">d'Avila</span> was in charge of Antwerp Castle. Doctor <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> thus
reports a conversation that he had with <span class="smcap">Rodas</span> on the 17th November
1576, thirteen days after the massacre began. This gives us the
Spanish view of the matter; and also such miserable excuse as they
could possibly offer for their villany, which however is no excuse at all.</p>

<p>We must remember that it would be the Ambassador's policy to
keep fair with <span class="smcap">Rodas</span>, who was master of the situation for the moment.</p>

1,021. <i>Dr <span class="smcap">Thomas Wilson</span> to the Privy Council.</i><br />
19 November 1576.</h4>

<p>And now, if it please your Honours, I am to declare
my coming to <span class="smcap">Rodas</span>, who did send unto me a Safe
Conduct for me and mine, upon a letter that I did write
to him from Ghent the 10th of this month: and the 17th
of the same, I did speak with him; immediately after my
coming to Antwerp.</p>

<p>And, delivering my Letters of Credit, [I] made him
acquainted with all that I did at Brussels; and that my
coming [to Flanders] was for the King's benefit and honour:
assuring him that if either the Estates would alienate this
country [of Flanders] to any foreign Prince, or would convert it
to themselves in prejudice of the King [<span class="smcap">Philip</span> II.]; Her
Majesty would employ all her force to withstand such attempts.</p>

<p>These speeches he liked very well: and was persuaded,
even by plain demonstration before my departure, that
my coming was to none other end; as it was not indeed.</p>

<p>Hereupon he declared unto me at large, the whole doings
at Brussels, the Mutinies made by the Spaniards at Alost
and elsewhere after their victory had at Zierikzee; and
blamed greatly the young heads at Brussels, and the fury
of the people to use the King's Council, and to break up
the door of his Palace, in such sort as they did: [<i><span class="smcap">Rodas</span>
was very nearly made prisoner in the Palace at Brussels</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<i>on 5th September 1576, by the Seigneur <span class="smcap">De H&egrave;ze</span>:</i>] clearing
the Council from all intention of evil to the town, or people,
of Brussels; making a very great discourse unto me of
this matter.</p>

<p>"Well," quoth I, "you are well revenged of the people
by your late victory here in Antwerp; which hath been
very bloody."</p>

<p>"Can you blame us?" quoth he. "Is it not natural to
withstand force with force; and to kill rather than to be
killed? and not to lose the King's piece committed to our
charge?"</p>

<p>All this I granted: and praised the Spaniards for their
valiant courage; that, being so few, could, with policy
and manhood, overcome so many.</p>

<p>"But now," quoth I, "I pray you give me leave to speak a
little. After you were lords of the town&mdash;which you got
wholly and quietly within two hours after your issuing
forth&mdash;what did you mean, to continue still killing, without
mercy, people of all sorts that did bear no armour at all;
and to murder them in their houses? to fire the chiefest and
fairest part of the city, after you were in full and quiet
possession of all? And not contented to spoil the whole
town, but to ransom those that were spoiled? And to spare
no Nation: although they did bear no arms at all; nor
yet were dealers in any practice at all against the King's
Ministers, or the Spaniards?"</p>

<p>His answer was, That the fury of the soldiers could
not be stayed: and that it grieved him much when the city
was on fire; and [that there] was no sparing to kill, when all
were conquered. The soldiers of Alost were adventurers,
had no Captains, desperate persons: and would not be ruled
by any Proclamation or commandment that could be given
or made.</p>

<p>"Well," quoth I, "if the Fury could not be stayed; yet
the Ransoming might be forbidden; which is an act against
the Law of all Nations." And therefore I required him,
in the name of the Queen's Majesty, to command restitution
to be made to the English Nation....</p>

<p>To conclude, he told me, That he would be glad to do
what he might for restitution; but he thought it would be
hard. For that which is to be paid with Bills, which for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Company amounteth to 5,000 crowns, at the month's end:
the same [Bills], he saith, shall be discharged; and the
bonds cancelled. Further he hath promised to grant a Safe
Conduct for all English Merchants to go (with their goods
remaining, ships, and merchandizes), without danger, withersoever
they will: not aiding, or abetting, the King's enemies.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>The inhabitants of Antwerp being still in fear, by reason
of their Castle, so long as the war was thus wavering,
fearing they should be, at some time, again surprised (terming
it a den of thieves, an invention of men full of cruelty, a
nest of tyranny, a receptacle of all filthy villany abomination
and wickedness) obtained leave of the States to dismantle it
towards the town.</p>

<p>The which the burghers began the 28th of August [1577],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
with such spleen as there was neither great nor small (wives
children, gentlewomen, and burghers; and all in general) but
would pull down a piece of it; men, women, and servants
going thither, with their Ensigns displayed, having many
victuallers on the plain before the Castle [<i>the Esplanade</i>]; so
as it seemed a camp. And although the masons' work was
great, strong, and thick; yet were they not long in beating
it down on that side.</p>

<p>Soon after, in imitation of that of Antwerp, followed the
dismantling of the Castles of Ghent, Utrecht, Valenciennes,
Bethune, Lille, Aire, and others; and the Citadel of Arras
was laid open towards the town. p. 647.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of April 1891, in an article on <i>The Baffling
of the Jesuits</i>, states</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Until Father <span class="smcap">Parsons</span> landed at Dover on June 11
[and Father <span class="smcap">Campion</span> on June 25], 1580; no Jesuit had
ever been seen in England. <span class="smcap">Ignatius Loyola</span> had been
dead just twenty-five years, and two of his associates in
founding the Society of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> were still alive. <span class="smcap">Loyola</span>
during his lifetime had admitted only a single Englishman
into the order, a lad of nineteen, of whom we know nothing
but that his name was <span class="smcap">Thomas Lith</span>, and that he was
admitted to the novitiate in June 1555. During the next
ten years, six more Englishmen entered the order, two of
them being men of some mark&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jasper Heywood</span>, formerly
Fellow of All Souls'; and <span class="smcap">Thomas Darbyshire</span>, who had
been Archdeacon of Essex and a Canon of St Paul's. In
the next decade, about the same number of English recruits
joined the society; three, and three only, were scholars of
any reputation&mdash;<span class="smcap">Parsons</span>, <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, and <span class="smcap">Henry Garnet</span>.
When the Jesuit Mission to England started, there were not
thirty English Jesuits in the world."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Vol. I., p. 130, is a letter written from Goa, 10 Nov. 1579, by
<span class="smcap">Thomas Stevens</span>, one of these English Jesuits.</p>

<p>The arrest and execution of <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span>&mdash;in Latin, <span class="smcap">Edmundus
Campianus</span>&mdash;was one of the most important events in our political
history during the year 1581. It made a profound impression throughout
Western Europe, and occasioned the publication of many tracts in
various languages. For further information on this subject, the Reader
is referred to <i><span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span>, A Biography</i>, by <span class="smcap">Richard Simpson</span>,
London, 1867-8; and also to Mr <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillow</span>'s <i>Biographical
Dictionary of the English Catholics</i>, now in progress.</p>

<p>The following account of the arrest by the man who made it, is printed
from a copy of the extremely rare original edition that is now in
Lambeth Palace Library [Press Mark, xxx. 8. 17.]. It was printed
[? privately printed] in 1581; but it was not entered at Stationers' Hall.
It was clearly produced before the execution of <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, on the 1st of
December of that year; to which there is no allusion in it; but
apparently not very much earlier, for the Writer says at page <a href="#Page_217">217</a>,
"Some men may marvel that I would be silent so long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>By this act of patriotism; <span class="smcap">George Elliot</span> earned the titles, among
the Roman Catholics, of <span class="smcap">Judas Elliot</span>, and of <span class="smcap">Elliot Iscariot</span>. It
is however only fair to him to state what moved him to go hunting after
Priests, Jesuits, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony Munday</span>, in his <i>Discovery of <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span> and his
Confederates, &amp;c.</i>, published on 29th January 1582, in giving an account
of <span class="smcap">Campion</span>'s trial, states:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">George Elliot</span>, one of the Ordinary Yeomen of Her
Majesty's Chamber, upon his oath, gave forth in evidence,
as followeth:</p>

<p>That he, living here in England among certain of that
sect, fell in acquaintance with one <span class="smcap">Payne</span>, a Priest; who
gave him to understand of a horrible treason intended
against Her Majesty and the State, which he did expect
shortly to happen.</p>

<p>The order, how, and after what manner, in brief is thus:</p>

<p>That there should be levied a certain company of armed
men; which, on a sudden, should enterprise a most monstrous
attempt. A certain company of these armed men
should be prepared against Her Majesty, as many against
my L[ord] of <span class="smcap">L[eicester]</span>, as many against my L[ord]
T[reasurer, Lord <span class="smcap">Burghley</span>], as many against Sir <span class="smcap">F[rancis]</span>
<span class="smcap">W[alsingham]</span>, and divers others whose names he doth not
well remember.</p>

<p>The deaths of these noble personages should be presently
fulfilled: and Her Majesty used in such sort as [neither]
modesty nor duty will suffer me to rehearse.
But this should be the general cry everywhere,

<span class="sidenote">Meaning the Queen of Scots. [A.M.]</span>

"Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>! Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>!"</p>

<p>It was also appointed and agreed upon, Who should
have this Man of Honour's room, and who should have
that Office. Everything was determined. There wanted
nothing but the coming over of such Priests and others as
were long looked for. [p. <a href="#Page_72">72.</a>]</p>

<p>Upon this report, the aforenamed <span class="smcap">George Elliot</span> took
occasion to question with this <span class="smcap">Payne</span>, How they could
find in their hearts to attempt an act of so great cruelty;
considering how high an offence it should be to GOD,
besides great danger might arise thereby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A most traitorous
and villanous
answer.
Of every true
subject to be
read with due
reverence of
the person.
[A.M.]</div>

<p>Whereto <span class="smcap">Payne</span> made answer, That the killing [of] Her
Majesty was no offence to GOD, nor the uttermost
cruelty they could use to her, nor [to] any
that took her part: but that they might as lawfully
do it as to a brute beast. And himself
would be one of the foremost in the executing [of]
this villanous and most traitorous action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <i>Lansd. MS.</i> 32, No. 60, in the British Museum, there is a paper to
the same effect, signed by G. E. [<span class="smcap">George Elliot</span>]. It is headed
<i>Certain Notes and Remembrances concerning a Reconciliation, &amp;c.</i>;
and bears marginal notes by Lord <span class="smcap">Burghley</span>.</p>

<p>It will probably be new to most readers that <span class="smcap">Elliot</span>'s arrest of
<span class="smcap">Campion</span> was a pure matter of accident. <span class="smcap">Elliot</span> went to Lyford
Manor House more particularly in search of <span class="smcap">Payne</span> the Priest, and
found <span class="smcap">Campion</span> there by chance. The Jesuit had been secretly, but
securely, wandering through the land from one Roman Catholic household
to another, for more than a year; despite the <i>utmost</i> efforts of the
English Government to put their hands on him: and at last he becomes
their prisoner almost by a pure accident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Campion</span> was lodged in the Tower on the 22nd July 1581. Two days
later, <span class="smcap">Anthony Munday</span>'s <i>Brief Discourse of the taking of <span class="smcap">Edmund
Campion</span> &amp;c.</i>, was entered at Stationers' Hall [<span class="smcap">Arber</span>, <i>Transcript &amp;c.</i>,
II. 397]. It was therefore very hurriedly written, and mainly from
information supplied by Master <span class="smcap">Humphrey Foster</span>, High Sheriff of
Berkshire: who, being himself a Roman Catholic, had been very slack
at the capture of <span class="smcap">Campion</span> [p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>]; but who, for his own protection,
puts a better face on things in <span class="smcap">Munday</span>'s hurriedly written <i>Discourse,
&amp;c.</i>
See pages <a href="#Page_207">207,</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Page_215">215,</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Page_217">217.</a>
</p>

<p>It is as a reply to this tract of <span class="smcap">Munday</span>'s, that <span class="smcap">Elliot</span> wrote the
following Text in 1581. In February 1582, they were however good
friends again; as will be seen at page <a href="#Page_223">223</a>.]</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">SOme</span> experience, Christian Reader, that I have
gathered by keeping company with such seditious
people as <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and his associates are,
partly moveth me to write this book; and
partly I am urged thereunto (although my
wisdom and skill be very slender to set down and pen
matter of less moment than this) for that I (being one of the
Two in Commission at that time from Her Highness's most
honourable Privy Council for the apprehending of the said
seditious <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and such like; and the chiefest cause
of the finding out of the said lewd people, as hereafter more
at large appeareth) do think it a great abuse that the most
part of Her Majesty's loving subjects shall be seduced to
believe an untruth; and myself and he which was in
Commission with me (whose name is <span class="smcap">David Jenkins</span>, one
of the Messengers of Her Majesty's Chamber) very vilely
slandered with a book set out by one <span class="smcap">Anthony Munday</span>
concerning the apprehension of the said lewd people&mdash;which,
for the truth thereof, is almost as far different from truth as
darkness from light; and as contrary to truth as an egg is
contrary in likeness to an oyster.</p>

<p>And therefore considering I am able to report a truth for
the manner of the finding and taking of the said seditious
persons; although fine skill be far from me to paint it out:
hoping the wise will bear with my want therein, and esteem
a true tale, be it never so bluntly told, rather than a lie, be it
never so finely handled&mdash;I have emboldened myself to take
this treatise in hand; wherein, God willing, I will describe
nothing but truth; as by the sequel shall appear. Which
is this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>That about four years past [?1578], the Devil (being a
crafty fox and chief Patron doubtless of the Pope's Prelacy;
having divers and many Officers and inferior substitutes to
the Pope, his chief Vicar; and intending by them to increase
the kingdom of this Antichrist) dispersed his said Officers
in divers places of this realm: where, like vagrant persons
(refusing to live within the lawful government of their
country) they lead a loose life; wandering and running
hither and thither, from shire to shire and country [<i>County</i>]
to country, with such store of Romish relics, Popish pelf,
trifles, and trash as were able to make any Christian heart,
that hath seen the trial of such practices as I have done,
even for sorrow to bleed. Only thereby to draw the
Queen's Majesty's subjects their hearts and faiths both from
GOD and Her Highness; as namely, by delivering unto them
<i>Bulls</i> from Rome, <i>Pardons, Indulgences</i>, Medals, <i>Agnus DEI</i>,
hallowed grains and beads, crucifixes, painted pictures, and
such other paltry: every part whereof they will not let [<i>stop</i>]
to say to be matters very necessary for salvation.</p>

<p>By reason whereof, most loving Reader, I myself, about
that time [1578], by the space of one quarter of a year
together, was deeply bewitched and drawn into their
darkness, as the blindest bayard of them all. But at the
last, even then (by GOD's great goodness, mighty providence,
and especial grace) all their enchantments, witchcrafts,
sorceries, devilish devices and practices were so broken and
untied in me; and the brightness of GOD's divine majesty
shining so surely in my heart and conscience: that I perceived
all their doings to be, as they are indeed, only shows without
substance, manifest errors and deceitful juggling casts, and
none others.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding I determined with myself, for certain
causes which I omit, to sound the depth of their devilish
drifts, if I might; and the rather therefore used and
frequented their company: whereby appeared unto me not
a few of their ungracious and villanous false hearts, faiths,
and disloyal minds, slanderous words, and most vile treasons
towards my most excellent and noble mistress, the Queen's
Majesty, and towards divers of her most honourable Privy
Council; in such sort as many times did make mine eyes
to gush out with tears for very sorrow and fear to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, lately [<i>about 14th May 1581</i>], I made my humble
submission unto the Right Honourable Her Highness's Privy
Council, for my unlawful living as aforesaid. At whose
hands I found such honourable dealing, and by their means
such mercy from Her Majesty, that I wish with all my
heart all the Papists, which are subjects born to Her Highness,
to run the same course that I have done: and then should
they easily see what difference there is between the good
and merciful dealing of our most gracious loving and natural
Prince; and the great treacheries of that great enemy to
our country, the Pope. For Her Highness freely forgiveth
offenders; but the Pope pardoneth for money. Her Grace's
hands are continually full of mercy, ready to deliver enough
freely to any that will desire and deserve it: and the Pope
his great clutches and fists are ready to deliver nothing but
devilish devices and paltry stuff of his own making, to set
country and country together by the ears; and yet for
these, hath he money.</p>

<p>Truly it is a most lamentable case that ever any Christian
should be seduced and drawn from the true worshipping of
GOD, and their duty to their Prince and country; as many
are by the Pope and his Satanical crew. I beseech GOD
turn their hearts, and grant us all amendment; which can
neither be too timely, if it were presently; nor never too
late, whensoever it shall happen: unless wilfully they proceed
in their dealings, which GOD forbid. For <i>humanum est
errare, perseverare belluinum</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after my submission and reconciliation, as aforesaid,
it pleased my Lords of Her Highness's most honourable
Privy Council to grant the Commission that I before spake
of, to myself and to the said <span class="smcap">David Jenkins</span>, for the
apprehension of certain lewd Jesuit Priests and other
seditious persons of like sort, wheresoever we should happen
to find them within England. Whereupon we determined
a certain voyage [<i>journey</i>]: in which <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span> the
aforesaid Jesuit and others were by us taken and brought to
the Tower of London, in manner as hereafter followeth.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="break"><i>The true manner of taking of <span class="smcap">Edmund<br />
Campion</span> and his associates.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_large_i.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT happened that after the receipt of our
Commission  aforesaid,  we  consulted
between ourselves, What way were best
to take first?  For we were utterly
ignorant where, or in what place, certainly
to find out the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, or his compeers.
And our consultation was shortly
determined: for the greatest part of our
travail and dealings in this service did lie chiefly upon mine
own determination, by reason of mine acquaintance and
knowledge of divers of [the] like sect.</p>

<p>It then presently came to my remembrance of certain
acquaintance which I once had with one <span class="smcap">Thomas Cooper</span>
a Cook, who, in November [1578] was two years, served
Master <span class="smcap">Thomas Roper</span> of [Orpington in] Kent; where, at
that time, I in like manner served: and both of us, about the
same month [November 1578], departed the said Master
<span class="smcap">Roper</span> his service; I into Essex, and the said <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> to
Lyford in Berkshire, to one Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span>. From whence,
within one half year after [<i>before May 1579</i>], I was advertised
in Essex, that the said Cook was placed in service;
and that the said Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span> was a very earnest Papist,
and one that gave great entertainment to any of that sect.</p>

<p>Which tale, being told me in Essex two years before
[1579] we entered [on] this journey, by GOD's great goodness,
came to my memory but even the day before [13th
July 1581] we set forth. Hereof I informed the said <span class="smcap">David
Jenkins</span>, being my fellow in Commission, and told him it
would be our best way to go thither first: for that it was
not meant that we should go to any place but where indeed
I either had acquaintance; or by some means possible in our
journey, could get acquaintance. And told him we would
dispose of our journey in such sort as we might come to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
said Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span>'s upon the Sunday about eight of the
clock in the morning: "where," said I, "if we find the said
Cook, and that there be any Mass to be said there that day,
or any massing Priest in the house; the Cook, for old
acquaintance and for that he supposeth me to be a Papist,
will bring me to the sight thereof."</p>

<p>And upon this determination, we set from London [on
Friday] the 14th day of July last; and came to the said
Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span>'s house, the 16th of the same month, being
Sunday, about the hour aforesaid.</p>

<p>Where, without the gates of the same house, we espied
one of the servants of the house, who most likely seemed, by
reason of his lying aloof, to be as it were a Scout Watcher,
that they within might accomplish their secret matters more
safely.</p>

<p>I called the said servant, and enquired of him for the
said <span class="smcap">Thomas Cooper</span> the Cook.</p>

<p>Who answered, That he could not well tell, whether he
were within or not.</p>

<p>I prayed him that he would friend me so much as to see;
and told him my name.</p>

<p>The said servant did so, it seemed; for the Cook came
forth presently unto us where we sat still upon horseback.
And after a few such speeches, as betwixt friend and friend
when they have been long asunder, were passed; still sitting
upon our horses, I told him That I had longed to see him;
and that I was then travelling into Derbyshire to see my
friends, and came so far out of my way to see him. And
said I, "Now I have seen you, my mind is well satisfied;
and so fare you well!"</p>

<p>"No," saith he, "that shall you not do before dinner."</p>

<p>I made the matter very earnest to be gone; and he, more
earnest and importune to stay me. But in truth I was as
willing to stay as he to have me.</p>

<p>And so, perforce, there was no remedy but stay we must.
And having lighted from horseback; and being by him
brought into the house, and so into the buttery, and there
caused to drink: presently after, the said Cook came and
whispered with me, and asked, Whether my friend (meaning
the said <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>) were within the Church or not? Therein
meaning, Whether he were a Papist or no?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>To which I answered, "He was not; but yet," said I, "he
is a very honest man, and one that wisheth well that way."</p>

<p>Then said the Cook to me, "Will you go up?" By which
speech, I knew he would bring me to a Mass.</p>

<p>And I answered him and said, "Yea, for God's sake, that
let me do: for seeing I must needs tarry, let me take something
with me that is good."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some men
blame me for
dissembling
the matter as I
did: but to do
my Prince and
country service,
I hold it
lawful to use
any reasonable
policy.  For the
Field is not
always won by
strength.</div>

<p>And so we left <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span> in the buttery; and I
was brought by the Cook through the hall, the
dining parlour, and two or three other odd rooms,
and then into a fair large chamber:  where there
was, at the same instant, one Priest, called <span class="smcap">Satwell</span>,
saying Mass; two other Priests kneeling
by, whereof one was <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, and the other
called <span class="smcap">Peters</span> alias <span class="smcap">Collington</span> [<i>or rather</i>
<span class="smcap">Colleton</span>]; three Nuns, and 37 other people.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Satwell</span> had finished his Mass; then <span class="smcap">Campion</span>
he invested himself to say Mass, and so he did: and at the
end thereof, made holy bread and delivered it to the people
there, to every one some, together with holy water; whereof
he gave me part also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I had once my
Commission in
my hand to
have dealt with
them myself
alone in the
Chamber.  If
I had, I pray
you judge
what had
happened unto
me.</div>

<p>And then was there a chair set in the chamber something
beneath the Altar, wherein the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span> did sit down;
and there made a Sermon very nigh an hour long:
the effect of his text being, as I remember, "That
Christ wept over Jerusalem, &amp;c." And so applied
the same to this our country of England for that
the Pope his authority and doctrine did not so
flourish here as the same <span class="smcap">Campion</span> desired.</p>

<p>At the end of which Sermon, I gat down unto
the said <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span> so soon as I could.  For during
the time that the Masses and the Sermon were
made, <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span> remained still beneath in the buttery or
hall; not knowing of any such matter until I gave him some
intelligence [of] what I had seen.</p>

<p>And so we departed, with as convenient expedition as we
might, and came to one Master <span class="smcap">Fettiplace</span>, a Justice of
the Peace in the said country [<i>County</i>]: whom we made
privy of our doings therein; and required him that, according
to the tenour of our Commission, he would take sufficient
Power and with us thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon the said Justice of Peace, within one quarter
of an hour, put himself in a readiness, with forty or fifty men
very well weaponed: who went, in great haste, together with
the said Master <span class="smcap">Fettiplace</span> and us, to the said Master
<span class="smcap">Yate</span> his house.</p>

<p>Where, at our coming upon the sudden, being about one
of the clock in the afternoon of the same day, before we
knocked at the gates which were then (as before they were
continually accustomed to be) fast shut (the house being
moated round about; within which moat was great store of
fruit trees and other trees, with thick hedge rows: so that
the danger for fear of losing of the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and his
associates was the more doubted); we beset the house with
our men round about the moat in the best sort we could
devise: and then knocked at the gates, and were presently
heard and espied; but kept out by the space of half an hour.</p>

<p>In which time, as it seemeth, they had hidden <span class="smcap">Campion</span>
and the other two Priests in a very secret place within the
said house; and had made reasonable purveyance for him
as hereafter is mentioned: and then they let us into the
house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One Nun got
away in country
maid's
apparel.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mistress <span class="smcap">Yate</span>
proferred us a
good sum of
money to have
given over the
search.</div>

<p>Where came presently to our sight, Mrs <span class="smcap">Yate</span>, the good
wife of the house; five Gentlemen, one Gentlewoman, and
three Nuns: the Nuns being then disguised in
Gentlewomen's apparel, not like unto that they
heard Mass in. All which I well remembered to have
seen, the same morning, at the Masses and Sermon aforesaid:
yet every one of them a great while denied it. And especially
the said Mistress <span class="smcap">Yate</span>; who could not be content
only to make a plain denial of the said Masses and
the Priests: but, with great and horrible oaths, forsware
the same, betaking herself to the Devil if
any such there were; in such sort as, if I had not seen them
with mine own eyes, I should have believed her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span>
was then, as
he is still, in
prison in
Reading, for
Papistry.</div>

<p>But knowing certainly that these were but bare
excuses, and that we should find the said
<span class="smcap">Campion</span> and his compeers if we made narrow
search; I eftsoons put Master <span class="smcap">Fettiplace</span> in remembrance
of our Commission: and so he, myself, and the said <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>
Her Majesty's Messenger, went to searching the house;
where we found many secret corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Continuing the search, although with no small toil, in the
orchards, hedges, and ditches, within the moat and divers
other places; at the last [we] found out Master <span class="smcap">Edward Yate</span>,
brother to the good man of the house, and two countrymen
called <span class="smcap">Weblin</span> and <span class="smcap">Mansfield</span>, fast locked together in a
pigeon house: but we could not find, at that time, <span class="smcap">Campion</span>
and the other two Priests whom we specially sought for.</p>

<p>It drew then something towards evening, and doubting
lest we were not strong enough; we sent our Commission to
one Master <span class="smcap">Foster</span>, High Sheriff of Berkshire; and to one
Master <span class="smcap">Wiseman</span>, a Justice of Peace within the same
County; for some further aid at their hands.</p>

<p>The said Master <span class="smcap">Wiseman</span> came with very good speed
unto us the same evening, with ten or twelve of his own
men, very able men and well appointed: but the said
Master <span class="smcap">Foster</span> could not be found, as the messenger that
went for him returned us answer.</p>

<p>And so the said house was beset the same night with at
the least three score men well weaponed; who watched the
same very diligently.</p>

<p>And the next day, being Monday [17th July 1581], in the
morning very early, came one Master <span class="smcap">Christopher
Lydcot</span>, a Justice of Peace of the same shire, with a great
sort [<i>company</i>] of his own men, all very well appointed: who,
together with his men, shewed such earnest loyal and forward
service in those affairs as was no small comfort and
encouragement to all those which were present, and did bear
true hearts and good wills to Her Majesty.</p>

<p>The same morning, began a fresh search for the said
Priests; which continued with very great labour until about
ten of the clock in the forenoon of the same day: but the
said Priests could not be found, and every man [was] almost
persuaded that they were not there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Master <span class="smcap">Lydcot</span>
was then
hard by.</div>

<p>Yet still searching, although in effect clean void of any
hope for finding of them, the said <span class="smcap">David Jenkins</span>, by
GOD's great goodness, espied a certain secret place,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which
he quickly found to be hollow; and with a pin of iron which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
he had in his hand much like unto a harrow tine, he forthwith
did break a hole into the said place: where
then presently he perceived the said Priests lying
all close together upon a bed, of purpose there
laid for them; where they had bread, meat, and drink sufficient
to have relieved them three or four days together.</p>

<p>The said <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span> then called very loudly, and said,
"I have found the traitors!"; and presently company
enough was with him: who there saw the said Priests
[that], when there was no remedy for them but <i>nolens volens</i>,
courteously yielded themselves.</p>

<p>Shortly after came one Master <span class="smcap">Reade</span>, another Justice
of the Peace of the said shire, to be assistant in these affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First myself
rode post to
the Court;
and, after me,
the said
Messenger.</div>

<p>Of all which matters, news was immediately carried in
great haste to the Lords of the Privy Council:
who gave further Commission that the said Priests
and certain others their associates should be
brought to the Court under the conduction of
myself and the said <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>; with commandment to
the Sheriff to deliver us sufficient aid forth of his shire,
for the safe bringing up of the said people.</p>

<p>After that the rumour and noise for the finding out
of the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, <span class="smcap">Satwell</span>, and <span class="smcap">Peters</span> <i>alias</i>
<span class="smcap">Collington</span>, was in the said house something assuaged;
and that the sight of them was to the people there no
great novelty: then was the said High Sheriff sent for
once again; who all that while had not been seen
in this service. But then came, and received into
his charge the said Priests and certain others
from that day until Thursday following.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Anthony
Munday</span> saith,
The Sheriff
and his men
gave him instructions
for
the setting out
of the said untrue
book.</div>

<p>The fourth Priest which was by us brought up
to the Tower, whose name is <span class="smcap">William Filbie</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
was not taken with the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and the rest in
the said house: but was apprehended and taken in our
watch [<i>on the 17th</i>], by chance, in coming to the said house
to speak with the said <span class="smcap">Peters</span> [<i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Colleton</span>], as he
said; and thereupon [was] delivered likewise in charge to
the Sheriff, with the rest.</p>

<p>Upon Thursday, the 20th day of July last [1581], we
set forwards from the said Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span> his house towards
the Court, with our said charge; being assisted by the
said Master <span class="smcap">Lydcot</span> and Master <span class="smcap">Wiseman</span>, and a great
sort [<i>company</i>] of their men; who never left us until we
came to the Tower of London. There were besides, that
guarded us thither, 50 or 60 Horsemen; very able men and
well appointed: which we received by the said Sheriff
his appointment.</p>

<p>We went that day to Henley upon Thames, where we
lodged that night.</p>

<p>And about midnight we were put into great fear by
reason of a very great cry and noise that the said <span class="smcap">Filbie</span>
made in his sleep; which wakened the most that were
that night in the house, and that in such sort that every
man almost thought that some of the prisoners had been
broken from us and escaped; although there was in and
about the same house a very strong watch appointed and
charged for the same. The aforesaid Master <span class="smcap">Lydcot</span> was
the first that came unto them: and when the matter was
examined, it was found no more but that the said <span class="smcap">Filbie</span>
was in a dream; and, as he said, he verily thought one
to be a ripping down his body and taking out his bowels.</p>

<p>The next day, being Friday [21st July 1581], we set
forward from Henley. And by the way received commandment
by a Pursuivant from the Lords of the Privy Council,
that we should stay that night at Colebrook; and the
next day after, being Saturday, to bring them through
the city of London unto the Tower, and there to deliver
them into the charge of Sir <span class="smcap">Owen Hopton</span> Knight, Her
Majesty's Lieutenant of the same; which accordingly we
did.</p>

<p>And this is, in effect, the true discourse [of] that was
used in the apprehension of the said <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and his
associates.</p>

<p>Some men may marvel that I would be silent so long
for the setting out of the manner of their takings; considering
I find myself aggrieved with the same untrue report
set out before by the said A. M[<span class="smcap">unday</span>]. In good faith
I meant nothing less than to take any such matter in
hand, if so great an untruth had not been published against
us that were doers in those affairs; and besides hitherto
divers other weightier business has partly hindered me
therein.</p>

<p>But now at the last, although very late, I have rudely
set down the verity in this matter: thinking it better to
tell a true tale by leisure, than a lie in haste; as the
said A. M., by his former book, hath done to his own
discredit, the deluding of Her Majesty's liege people, and
the slander of some which have intermeddled in the said
cause.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">SInce</span> the committing of the persons before-named

to the Tower as aforesaid, there hath
been, for my service done in those and
such like affairs, no small nor few brags,
threatenings, curses, and evil wishes given
out against me by such as, if they were
known, deserve both little liberty and small
favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Campion</span>,
when he first saw me after his apprehension, said unto
me, That my service done in the taking of him would be
unfortunate to me. And in our journey towards the
Tower, he advised me to get out of England for the safety
of my body.</div>

<p>Some of my friends have doubted [<i>feared</i>]
lest that sort of lewd people would do their
good wills to hurt me by some secret device,
as conjuration, witchcraft, or such like; the
which I rather think to be true, for that, shortly
after the foresaid business ended, it pleased
GOD to visit me with some sickness after I
was gone to bed at night; which indeed for
two or three hours handled me something hardly. But,
GOD I take to witness, I never was of that opinion
that it came to me by any other means but only by
riding post two or three journies about the business
aforesaid.</p>

<p>Yet, within one day or two after my sickness, there came
to a neighbour's house [to] where I lodged in Southwark, one
Mistress <span class="smcap">Beysaunt</span>, a widow, whose abode is most about
St. Mary Overies, and at the last by report smelleth of
Papistry, and asked the good wife of the house for me, and
what she had lately heard of me.</p>

<p>She answered, She knew me not; nor nothing she had
heard of me.</p>

<p>Then said Mistress <span class="smcap">Beysaunt</span>, "The very truth is, it is
he that took <span class="smcap">Campion</span> and the rest of the company that are
in the Tower; and was the cause that Master <span class="smcap">Roper</span>
and divers other good men are troubled:

<span class="sidenote">It seemeth she
was privy to
some secret
practice
against me.</span>

and the last day," saith she, "he did fall mad in the
street, and was carried so into his lodging;
and is not like[ly] to escape with life. I pray
you inquire further of him, and let me have knowledge
thereof."</p>

<p>So that hereby I may plainly see that the Papists take
great care for me: but whether it be for my weal or woe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and what her meaning was, let the world judge. But let
the Devil, the Pope, and them do what they can; my faith
standeth so sure on <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> my Saviour, that through
him I defy them all.</p>

<p>There hath been great murmuring and grudging against
me about the committing of the aforesaid Master <span class="smcap">Thomas
Roper</span>; and many faults have been found for the same.</p>

<p>What I did therein I mean not here to recite: but my
dealings in those causes are known to such as before
whom I think the fault finders dare not shew their faces.
But whatsoever I did against him, I would have done
against mine own father; the case standing as it did.
Yet such find-faults, to make the matter seem more
odious to the World against me, do not stick to report
and say, That the said Master <span class="smcap">Roper</span> hath brought me
up from my childhood to this day at his only charges.
Which is so false as GOD is true. For although I was
his servant; I continued with him, in all, not past one
year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to conclude. A great number of such like untruths
have been published against me, and no few bold brags;
as report goeth. I could name some if I would: but I
let them pass; unless I be commanded to the contrary
by such as have authority to deal with me therein. GOD
grant them amendment, I mean not towards myself; or
else make their doings known in such sort as they may
have their deservings; or at least be put to the mercy of
Her Majesty: to whose Highness, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> send long life, a
prosperous reign, with all joy and felicity!</p>

<p>When I had thoroughly perused this book, noting the
traitorous effects and slanderous speeches therein contained,
receiving the judgment likewise of divers learned and godly
men: as well to correct the manifest untruths wherewith
this pamphlet is notably stuffed, as also that the godly and
virtuous may discern their apparent impudency and wicked
nature; I resolved myself to shape a brief <i>Answer</i> to such
a shameless libel; myself being therein untruly and
maliciously abused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The manner of
the aforesaid
traitorous
book. [A.M.]</div>

<p>First, our nameless historiographer, because he would aim
his course after some odd manner of conveyance,
taketh occasion to begin his book with the taking
of <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, his bringing to the Tower, what
happened in his time of stay there, and lastly his martyrdom
(as he termeth it) with two other holy and devout Priests;
and, in this manner continuing his unadvised labour, he
beginneth as hereafter followeth:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">George Elliot</span> (sometime servant to Master <span class="smcap">Thomas
Roper</span>; and since belonging to a Gentlewoman, the widow of
Sir <span class="smcap">William Petre</span>: in whose service he made show to be a
sound and good Catholic) not long since committed a murder,

<span class="sidenote">To build upon
hearsay
proveth but a
slender foundation.
[A.M.]</span>

as men say: for which offence, fearing the danger
that was like[ly] to ensue, he went and submitted
himself to one of the chief Lords in the Court; and,
the better to win his favour, on his own behalf
promised to deliver into his hands the Father <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>This promise, saith he, was received; and unto the said
<span class="smcap">George</span> and an Officer, was delivered Commission to take and
apprehend the said <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Then went they on their way, and coming into Berkshire to
[the] house of one Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span>; <span class="smcap">George Elliot</span> met with
the Cook of the house with whom he was very well acquainted,
because they had before both served one Master.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">His Master
was then in the
gaol at Reading.
Judge then how
<span class="smcap">Campion</span>
could be within
"with his
Master."
[A.M.]</div>

<p><i>The Cook, thinking no ill, began to tell him many
things; and that Father <span class="smcap">Campion</span> was in the house
with his Master.</i></p>

<p><i>Upon which report, <span class="smcap">George</span> sent his fellow to the
Justice, who was a very great Calvinist. And he in
mean while was brought into the house by the said
Cook: where, like another <span class="smcap">Judas</span>, traitor and disloyal, he first
attended the sacrifice of the Mass which was celebrated that
day by the Father <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, as also a Sermon which he made.
In which time behold a good man came running, willing them
to take heed of a present treason.</i></p>

<p><i>Scantly was all carried away that had served for the Mass
and the Sermon; but the Justice was there arrived with [a]
very great force, besetting the house round about, that none
should escape away.</i></p>

<p><i>After very diligent search through all the chambers and
other more secret places; they were determined to return, as not
finding anything, until they were advertised (either by <span class="smcap">George</span>,
who had understood it of the Cook; or by some other) of a
certain corner, more dark and subtle; where they found the
Father <span class="smcap">Edmund</span> and two other Priests hidden: who, the same
day, with Gentlemen and other persons, were sent up to
London; a spectacle of great joy unto their adversaries.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">By that which
followeth,

the truth of this

<p>This much of our French historian's words, I thought

good in this place to set down: because the disproof

that were used of him in the French book.</p>

<p>Whereupon, taking good advice, and noting the circumstances

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em;"><span class="smcap">ABout</span> three years since [? 1578] it was my fortune
to serve Master <span class="smcap">Thomas Roper</span> of
[Orpington in] Kent. With whom I had not
stayed past eleven weeks, but <span class="smcap">Payne</span> the Priest
(of whom mention is made [see page <a href="#Page_205">205</a>] in the
<i>Discovery of <span class="smcap">Campion</span></i> set forth by the Author of this book
[<i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap">Anthony Munday</span>]) inticed me [in November 1578]
from thence to serve my Lady <span class="smcap">Petre</span>, to whom the said
<span class="smcap">Payne</span> served craftily as Steward of her house.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Who frequenteth
their
company shall
find all their
dealings disloyal
and
traitorous.
[A.M.]</div>

<p>With her I continued almost two years [? Nov. 1578-
Nov. 1580]. In which time, being myself bent
somewhat to that religion, frequenting the company
of a number of Papists, I perceived their
dealings to be, as they are indeed, full of wicked
treasons and unnatural dispositions, too bad to
be named. The conceit whereof (examining
first my duty to GOD, next my love to my Princess
[<i>Sovereign</i>], and last the care of my country,) by the
grace and permission of GOD, offered me so great disliking
of their dealings that, so warily and conveniently
as I might, I weaned my affection from their abominable
infection: nevertheless using their companies still, for that
it gave me the better occasion to see into the depth of their
horrible inventions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>From my Lady <span class="smcap">Petre</span>, in November was twelvemonth
[1580], by entreaty I came to Master <span class="smcap">Roper</span>'s again.
With whom I continued till Whitsuntide last [14th May
1581], when my conscience hardly digesting such a weighty
burden as with their devices and practices it was very
sore ladened; I was constrained to give over that slavish
kind of life, and humbly committed my reconciliation to
the Right Honourable and my good Lord, the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Leicester</span>: to whom I made known the grievous estate
of my life which, for the space of four years, I had endured
amongst them.</p>

<p>Now whereas it hath pleased my adversary to set down
that I</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>committed a murder, and to avoid the danger of law
offered to the aforesaid my good Lord to deliver
unto him <span class="smcap">Edmund Campion</span>, thereby to obtain my
pardon.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">It is very unlike[ly] that he, which never
saw <span class="smcap">Campion</span> in all his life, nor knew
where he was, could make any promise to bring him forth.  [A.M.]
</div>

<p>How untrue this is, his Honour very well knoweth; and so do
a number more besides. For, in truth, I neither,
as then, knew <span class="smcap">Campion</span>, had never seen him in
all my life, nor knew where or in what place
he was, it is very unlike[ly] then I should make
him any such promise. But that he may learn
another time to order his matters with more
truth and discretion; I will set down both how
I went, with what Commission, and to what intent: and
then let him have judgment according to the credit of his
Work:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I had revealed the traitorous speeches of <span class="smcap">Payne</span>
the Priest (how, and after what manner, you may read in
the book [by <span class="smcap">Anthony Munday</span>] before expressed [see
page <a href="#Page_205">205</a>]) I was demanded, If I knew where he was at that
time?</p>

<p>I could not make any certain answer.</p>

<p>Whereupon I was demanded again, If I would do my
endeavour to search him out?</p>

<p>Whereto, according to my bounden duty, I agreed right
willingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Then was I appointed, in company with <span class="smcap">David Jenkins</span>,
one of the Messengers of Her Majesty's Chamber;

<span class="sidenote">I saw the
Warrant myself;
and
neither was
<span class="smcap">Campion</span>,
<span class="smcap">Payne</span>, or any
one named
therein: but <i>all
Priests,
Jesuits, and
such seditious
persons.</i>
[A.M.]
</span>

and to us was delivered a Warrant to take and
apprehend, not any one man, but <i>all Priests,
Jesuits, and such like seditions persons</i>, as in
our journey we should meet withal. Neither was
<span class="smcap">Campion</span>, <span class="smcap">Payne</span>, or any one man named in the
Warrant: for that as the one was judged hard to
be found; so it was uncertain where to find him
[that] I knew well enough.</p>

<p>Wherefore remembering, when I served Master <span class="smcap">Roper</span>,
that there was one <span class="smcap">Thomas Cooper</span> a Cook, who
served him likewise, and also knew the aforesaid <span class="smcap">Payne</span>;
to him I thought good to go, because I had understanding
that he dwelt at Lyford in Berkshire with one Master
<span class="smcap">Yate</span> who was a very earnest Papist and gave great entertainment
to all of that sect: thinking as it might so fall
out that we either might find the said <span class="smcap">Payne</span> there, or else
understand where he was. And considering the generality
[<i>comprehensiveness</i>] of our Warrant, some other Priests
might chance to be there; in respect that he was such
a host for all of that disposition.</p>

<p>When we came to Lyford, and had talked with this
aforesaid <span class="smcap">Thomas Cooper</span>; we were framing ourselves to
depart thence, not having been within the house at all.
But he desiring us to stay dinner, we alighted and went
in with him; he not telling me that</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Campion</span> was there with his Master</i></p>

<p>for he [<i>Master <span class="smcap">Yate</span></i>] was then in the gaol at Reading; or
any other Priest: though it hath pleased our nameless
Author to write so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A holy kind of
Church,
whereof the
Devil is Vicar.
[A.M.]
</div>

<p>When we were within the house, this <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> brought
us into the buttery: where he, whispering me in
the ear, demanded, If my fellow were within the
Church or no? as much to say as, Whether he
was a Papist or no?</p>

<p>I answered, "He was not; yet nevertheless," quoth I,
"he is a very honest man, and one that wisheth well that
way."</p>

<p>Then said the Cook, "Will you go up?"</p>

<p>Hereby I understood that he would bring me to a Mass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Whereto I consenting, leaving <span class="smcap">David Jenkins</span> in the
buttery, he brought me up: where, after one <span class="smcap">Satwell</span> alias
<span class="smcap">Foord</span> had said Mass, <span class="smcap">Campion</span> prepared himself to say
Mass. And there was the first time that ever I saw
<span class="smcap">Campion</span> in all my life: not having heard by any that
he was there in the house, before I was brought up into the
chamber.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As concerning how he was taken, how he was brought
up to London, and how all things passed in that service;
I have already set down in my book imprinted: which
conferring with his false report, you shall find it as much to
differ as truth doth from falsehood.</p>

<p>This have I thought good here to set down, in the
reproof of him who hath published such a manifest untruth:
and as concerning what I have reported to be spoken
by <span class="smcap">Payne</span>, I am ready at all times to justify it with
my death, that they are his words according as he spake
them.</p>

In <span class="smcap">Munday</span>'s <i>Brief Discourse, &amp;c.</i> [24 July 1581] there is a
description of this "secret place"; which may be correct as to its situation
in the Manor House at Lyford:</p>

<p>A chamber, near the top of the house; which was but very simple:
having in it a large great shelf with divers tools and instruments both
upon it, and hanging by it; which they judged to belong to some crossbow
maker. The simpleness of the place caused them to use small
suspicion in it: and [they] were departing out again; but one in the
company, by good hap, espied a chink in the wall of boards whereto
this shelf was fastened, and through the same he perceived some light.
Drawing his dagger, he smit a great hole in it; and saw there was a
room behind it: whereat the rest stayed, searching for some entrance
into it; which by pulling down a shelf they found, being a little hole for
one to creep in at.</p>

of five Carracks, that went from Lisbon to Goa and back; written
by <span class="smcap">Jan Huyghen van Linschoten</span>, a Dutchman, who made that

Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> Knight, Lieutenant General of the Fleet
prepared by the Honourable Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> Knight, Lord
Warden of the Stanneries of Cornwall and Devon. Wherein,
chiefly, the</i> Santa Clara <i>of Biscay, a ship of 600 tons, was
taken: and the two East Indian Carracks, the</i> Santa Cruz

taken and brought into Dartmouth the 7th of September 1592.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Ralegh</span>, upon Commission
received from Her Majesty for an Expedition
to be made to the West Indies,
slacked not his uttermost diligence to
make full provision of all things necessary:
as, both in his choice of good ships,
and [of] sufficient men to perform the
action, evidently appeared. For [of] his
ships, which were in number fourteen or fifteen, those two of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Her Majesty's, the <i>Garland</i> and the <i>Foresight</i>, were the
chiefest. The rest [were] either his own, or his good friends',
or [belonged to] Adventurers of London. For the Gentlemen
his consorts and Officers, to give them their right, they
were so well qualited in courage, experience, and discretion
as the greatest Prince might repute himself happy to be
served with their like.</p>

<p>The honour of Lieutenant General was imposed upon Sir
<span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>, a Gentleman, for his manifold good and
heroical parts, thought every way worthy of that commandment.
With whom, after Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> returned,
was joined in Commission, Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span>: who,
for his special skill and knowledge in marine causes, had
formerly carried employments of like, or greater, place. The
rest of the Captains, soldiers, and sailors were men of notable
resolution; and, for the most part, such as heretofore
had given to the World sufficient proof of their valour in
divers Services of the like nature.</p>

<p>With these ships, thus manned, Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> departed
towards the West country, there to store himself with
such further necessaries as the state of his Voyage [<i>Expedition</i>]
did needfully require. Where the westerly winds, blowing
for a long time contrary to his course, bound and constrained
him to keep harbour so many weeks that the fittest season
for his purpose was gone; the minds of his people, much
altered; his victuals, consumed: and withal Her Majesty,
understanding how crossly all this sorted, began to call the
procedings of this preparation into question.</p>

<p>Insomuch that, whereas the 6th of May [1592] was first
come before Sir <span class="smcap">Walter</span> could put to sea; the very next
day, Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span>, in a Pinnance of my [Lord
<span class="smcap">Howard</span> of Effingham, the] Lord Admiral's, called the
<i>Disdain</i>, met him: and brought to him, from Her Majesty,
Letters of Revocation, with commandment to relinquish for
his own part, the intended attempt; and to leave the charge
and conduct of all things in the hands of Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>
and Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span>.</p>

<p>But Sir <span class="smcap">Walter</span> (finding his honour so far engaged in
the undertaking of this Voyage [<i>Expedition</i>] as, without proceeding,
he saw no remedy either to salve his reputation;
or to content those his friends, which had put in adventures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of great sums with him: and making construction of the
Queen's Letters, in such sort, as if her commandment had
been propounded in indifferent terms, either to advance
forward, or to retire, at his own discretion) would in no
case yield to leave his Fleet now under sail.</p>

<p>Wherefore continuing his course into the sea, he met,
within a day or two, with certain Sails lately come from
Spain. Among which was a ship appertaining to Monsieur
<span class="smcap">Gourdon</span>, Governor of Calais: and [he] found aboard her,
one Master <span class="smcap">Nevel Davies</span>, an Englishman, who (having
endured a long and miserable captivity for the space of
twelve years [1580-1592]; partly in the Inquisition in Spain)
was now, by good fortune, escaped; and upon [his] return to
his [own] country.</p>

<p>This man, among other things, reported for certain, That
there was little hope of any good this year to be done in the
West India: considering that the King of Spain had sent
express order to all the ports, both of the Islands and of
<i>Terra firma</i>, that no ship should stir that year, nor any
treasure be laid aboard for Spain.</p>

<p>But neither this unpleasant relation, nor aught else, could
stay his proceedings, until a tempest of strange and uncouth
violence, arising upon Thursday the 11th of May, when he
was athwart Cape Finisterre, had so scattered the greater
part of the Fleet, and sunk his boats and Pinnaces: that as
the rest were driven and severed, some this way, and some
that; Sir <span class="smcap">Walter</span> himself, being in the <i>Garland</i> of Her
Majesty's [Ships], was in danger to be swallowed up of the sea.</p>

<p>Whereupon Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> finding that the season
of the year was too far gone to proceed with the enterprise
which he had upon Panama, having been held on the English
coast from February till May [1592], and thereby spent
three months' victuals; and considering withal that to lie
upon the Spanish coast, or at the Islands [of the Azores], to
attend the return of the East [Indian], or West Indian Fleets,
was rather a work of patience than aught else: he gave
directions to Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span>
to divide the Fleet in two parts. Sir <span class="smcap">Martin</span> with
the <i>Garland</i>, Captain <span class="smcap">George Giffard</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Henry
Thin</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Grenville</span>, and others, to lie off the South
Cape [<i>Cape St. Vincent</i>]; thereby to amaze the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Fleet, and to hold them on their own coast, while Sir <span class="smcap">John
Burrough</span> [in the <i>Roebuck</i>], Captain [Sir] <span class="smcap">Robert Crosse</span>
[in the <i>Foresight</i>,] Captain <span class="smcap">Thomson</span> [in the <i>Dainty</i>], and
others, should attend the Islands for the Carracks [from Goa]
or any other Spanish ships coming from Mexico or other
parts of the West Indies.</p>

<p>Which direction took effect [<i>was effectual</i>] accordingly.
For the King of Spain's Admiral, receiving intelligence that
the English Fleet was come on the coast, attended to defend
the south parts of Spain, and to keep himself as near Sir
<span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span> as he could, to impeach [<i>hinder</i>] him
in all things which he might undertake: and thereby
neglected the safe conduct of the Carracks; with whom it
fared as hereafter shall appear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Santa
Clara</i>, a Biscayen
ship of
600 tons, taken.</div>

<p>Before the Fleet severed themselves, they met with a great
Biscayen on the Spanish coast, called [the] <i>Santa
Clara</i>, a ship of 600 tons. The noise of the artillery
on both sides being heard; immediately they
drew to their Fleet. Where, after a reasonably hot fight, the
ship was entered and mastered: which they found fraighted
with all sorts of small ironwork, as horse-shoes, nails, plough-shares,
iron bars, spikes, bolts, locks, gimbols, and such like,
valued by us at &pound;6,000 or &pound;7,000 [=&pound;24,000 <i>to</i> &pound;30,000
<i>now</i>] but worth to them treble the value. This Biscayen
was sailing towards San Lucar [de Barrameda, the Port of
Seville], there to take in some further provision for the West
India.</p>

<p>This ship being first rummaged, and after sent for England:
our Fleet coasted along towards the South Cape of St.
Vincent.</p>

<p>And, by the way, about the Rock [<i>Cape da Roca</i>] near
Lisbon, Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> in the <i>Roebuck</i> spying a Sail
afar off, gave her present chase: which, being a Fly-boat
and of good sail [<i>a good sailer</i>], drew him far southwards
before he could fetch her; but at last she came under his lee,
and struck sail.</p>

<p>The Master of which Fly-boat coming aboard him, confessed,
that the King [<span class="smcap">Philip II.</span>] indeed had prepared a
great Fleet in San Lucar [de Barrameda] and Cadiz; and, as
the report in Spain was current, for the West Indies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>But indeed the Spanish King had provided this Fleet
upon this counsel:</p>

<p>He received intelligence that Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> was
to put out strong for the West India. To impeach him, and
to ranconter [<i>encounter</i>] his force; he appointed this Fleet:
although, looking for the arrival of his East Indian Carracks,
he first ordained those ships to waft [<i>convoy</i>] them from the
Azores. But persuading himself that if the Fleet of Sir
<span class="smcap">Walter Ralegh</span> did go for the West India, then the
Islands should have none to infest them but small Men of
War; which the Carracks of themselves would be well able
to match: his order was to Don <span class="smcap">Alonso de Ba&ccedil;an</span>,
brother to the Marquis of <span class="smcap">Santa Cruz</span>, and General of his
Armada, to pursue Sir <span class="smcap">Walter</span>'s Fleet, and to confront
him; what course soever he held.</p>

<p>And that this was true, our men in short time by proof
understood. For Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> (not long after the
taking of his last prize, the Fly-boat), as he sailed back again
towards the rest of his company, discovered the Spanish
Fleet to seaward of him: which, having likewise spied him
betwixt them and the shore, made full account to bring him
safe into [a] Spanish harbour; and therefore spread themselves
in such sort before him, that indeed his danger was
very great. For both the liberty of the sea was brought into
a narrow straight [<i>distance</i>]; and the shore, being enemy

<span class="sidenote">Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>
in great
danger of the
Spanish Fleet.</span>

[<i>hostile</i>] could give him no comfort of relief. So
that, trusting to GOD's help only and his good
sail [<i>sailing</i>], he thrust out from among them, in
spite of all their force; and, to the notable illusion of all
their cunning, which they shewed to the uttermost in laying
the way for his apprehension.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>, having happily escaped
their clutches; finding the coast guarded by this Fleet; and
knowing it was but folly to expect a meeting there with Sir
<span class="smcap">Martin Frobisher</span> (who understanding of this Armada, as
well as himself, would be sure not to come that way), began
to shape his course to the Azores, according to Sir <span class="smcap">Walter
Ralegh</span>'s direction: and came in sight of St.

<span class="sidenote">The Isle of St. Michael.</span>

Michael; running so near by Villa Franca, that he
might easily discern the ships lying there at anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Divers small
ships taken.</div>

<p>Divers small Caravels both here and between St George's
[Island] and the Pike [<i>Pico</i>], in his course towards
Flores, he intercepted: of which no great intelligence
for his affairs could be understood.</p>

<p>Arriving before Flores, upon Thursday the 21st of June,
towards evening, [in the <i>Roebuck</i>], accompanied only by
Captain <span class="smcap">Caufield</span> and the Master of his ship; the rest not
being yet arrived: he made towards the shore with his boat:
finding all the people of Santa Cruz, a village of

<span class="sidenote">Santa Cruz, a
village in the
Isle of Flores.</span>

that island, in arms; fearing their landing, and
ready marshalled to defend their town from spoil.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, contrariwise, made signs of amity unto them by
advancing a white flag, a common token of peace: which
was answered again of them with the like. Whereupon
ensued intercourses of good friendship; and pledges were
taken on both sides, the Captain of the town for them and
Captain <span class="smcap">Caulfield</span> for ours. So that whatsoever our men
wanted, which that place could supply, either in fresh water,
victuals, or the like, was very willingly granted [<i>i.e. for payment</i>]
by the inhabitants; and good leave had they to refresh
themselves on shore, as much and as oft as they would,
without restraint.</p>

<p>At this Santa Cruz, Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> was informed
that indeed there was among them no expectation of any
Fleet to come from the West: but from the East,

<span class="sidenote">News of the
East Indian
Carracks.</span>

that no longer since than three days before his
arrival [<i>i.e.</i> 18th June 1592] a Carrack was passed by for
Lisbon, and that there were four Carracks more behind, of
one consort [<i>company or Fleet</i>].</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, being very glad of this news, stayed no longer
on shore, but presently embarked himself: having only in
company a small Bark, of 60 tons [? the <i>Phœnix</i>, see page
255], belonging to one Master <span class="smcap">Hopkins</span> of Bristol.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile that these things thus passed at Flores;
part of the rest of the English Fleet, which Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>
had left upon the coast of Spain, drew also towards
the Azores. And whereas he quickly, at sea, had discovered
one of the Carracks [the <i>Santa Cruz</i>]: the same evening, he
might descry two or three of [<span class="smcap">George Clifford</span>] the Earl
of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>'s ships [<i>two of them were the</i> Tiger <i>and the</i>
Sampson], whereof one Master <span class="smcap">Norton</span> was Captain [<i>or as</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<i>we should now say, Commodore</i>]; which having, in like sort,
kenned the Carrack, pursued her by that course which they
saw her to run towards the Islands.</p>

<p>But on no side was there any way made, by reason of a
great calm which yielded no breath to spread a sail. Insomuch
that (fitly to discover her what she was; of what
burden, force, and countenance) Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> took
his boat, and rowed the space of three miles, to make her
[out] exactly; and, being returned, he consulted with the
better sort of the Company then present, upon the boarding
[of] her in the morning.</p>

<p>But a very mighty storm arising in the night, the extremity
thereof forced them all to weigh anchors; yet
their care was such in wrestling with the weather, not to lose
the Carrack: [so] that, in the morning (the tempest being
qualified, and our men bearing again with the shore), they
might perceive the Carrack very near the land; and the
Portugals confusedly carrying on shore such things as they
could, [in] any manner of way, convey out of her. And
seeing the haste our men made to come upon them; [they]
forsook her.</p>

<p>But first, that nothing might be left commodious to our
men; [they] set fire to that which they could not

<span class="sidenote">
A Carrack,
called the
<i>Santa Cruz</i>,
set on fire.</span>

carry with them: intending by that means, wholly
to consume her; that neither glory of victory, nor
benefit of ship, might remain to ours.</p>

<p>And lest the approach and industry of the English should
bring means to extinguish the flame, thereby to preserve the
residue of that which the fire had not destroyed: being 400
of them in number and well armed, they intrenched themselves
on land so near the Carrack, that she, being by their
forces protected and our men kept aloof off; the fire might
continue to the consumption of the whole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
A hundred of
our men
landed.</div>

<p>This being noted by Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>; he soon provided
a present remedy for this mischief. For
landing 100 of his men (whereof many did swim,
and wade more than breast high, to shore) and easily scattering
those that presented themselves to guard the coast: he
no sooner drew towards their new trenches, but they fled
immediately; leaving as much as the fire had spared [of the
<i>Santa Cruz</i>] to be the reward of our men's pains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Here were taken, among others, one <span class="smcap">Vincent Fonseca</span>,
a Portugal, Purser of the Carrack; with two others, one an
Almain [<i>German</i>], and the second a Low Dutchman [<i>Hollander</i>]
Cannoniers: who, refusing to make any voluntary
report of those things which were demanded of them, had
the torture threatened; the fear whereof, at the last, wrested
from them this intelligence:</p>

<p>That, within fifteen days, three other greater Carracks than
that [the <i>Santa Cruz</i>] lately fired, would arrive at the same
Island [of Flores]. And that being five Carracks in the
Fleet at their departure from Goa, to wit, the <i>Buen Jesus</i>,
Admiral [<i>Flag Ship</i>]; the <i>Madre de Dios</i>; the <i>San Bernardo</i>;
the <i>San Christophoro</i>; and the <i>Santa Cruz</i>, whose fortune
you have already heard: they had received special commandment
from the King [<span class="smcap">Philip II.</span>] not to touch, in any case,
at the Island of St. Helena, where the Portugal Carracks,
in their return from the East India, were always, till now,
wont to arrive, to refresh themselves with water and victuals.
And the King's reason was, because of the English Men of
War: who, as he was informed, lay there in wait to intercept
them. If therefore their necessity of water should drive
them to seek [a] supply anywhere, he appointed them
Angola, in the main[land] of Africa; with order

<span class="sidenote">
Angola, a new watering place for the Carracks.</span>

there to stay only the taking in of water, to
avoid the inconvenience of infections, whereunto
that hot latitude is dangerously subject. The last rendezvous
for them all was the Island of Flores: where the
King assured them not to miss of his Armada, thither
sent of purpose for their wafting [<i>convoy</i>] to Lisbon.</p>

<p>Upon this information, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span> drew to Council [of War],
meeting there Captain <span class="smcap">Norton</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Downton</span>, Captain
<span class="smcap">Abraham Cocke</span>, Captains of three ships of [<span class="smcap">George Clifford</span>,]
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>; Master <span class="smcap">Thomson</span> of
Harwich, Captain of the <i>Dainty</i> of Sir <span class="smcap">John Hawkins</span>'s, one
of Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Raleigh</span>'s Fleet; and Master <span class="smcap">Christopher
Newport</span>, Captain of the <i>Golden Dragon</i>, newly returned
from the West Indies; and others.</p>

<p>These being assembled, he communicated with them what
he had understood of the foresaid Examinates; and what
great presumptions of truth their relation did carry: wishing
that forasmuch as GOD and good fortune had brought them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
together in so good a season, they would shew the uttermost
of their endeavours to bring these Easterlings [<i>here meaning,
the Carracks from the East: an unusual application of a word
ordinarily applied to Baltic ships</i>] under the lee of English
obedience.</p>

<p>Hereupon a present accord, on all sides, followed; not to
part company, or leave off those seas, till time should present
cause to put their consultations in execution.</p>

<p>The next day [? 29th June 1592], Her Majesty's good Ship
the <i>Foresight</i>, commanded by Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Crosse</span>, came in
to the rest: and he, likewise informed of the matter, was
soon drawn into this Service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, with all these ships, departing thence [to
some] six or seven leagues to the West of Flores; they
spread themselves abroad from the North to the South;
each ship two leagues, at the least, distant from another.
By which order of extension, they were able to discover
the space of two whole degrees [=140 <i>miles</i>] at sea.</p>

<p>In this sort, they lay from the 29th of June to the 3rd of
August [1592].</p>

<p>[At] what time, Captain <span class="smcap">Thomson</span>, in the <i>Dainty</i>, had
first sight of the huge Carrack, called the <i>Madre de Dios</i>
[the <i>Mother of God</i>]; one of the greatest receipt [<i>burden</i>]
belonging to the Crown of Portugal.</p>

<p>The <i>Dainty</i>, being of excellent sail, got the start of the
rest of our Fleet: and began the conflict, somewhat to her
cost, with the slaughter and hurt of divers of her men.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Within a while after, Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>, in the <i>Roebuck</i>
of Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Raleigh</span>'s [Fleet], was at hand to second

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>

her: who saluted her with shot of great ordnance, and continued
the fight, within musket shot, (assisted by Captain
<span class="smcap">Thomson</span> [in the <i>Dainty</i>] and Captain <span class="smcap">Newport</span> [in the
<i>Golden Dragon</i>] till Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Crosse</span>, Vice Admiral
of the Fleet [there present], came up; [having] been to
leeward.</p>

<p>At whose arrival, Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> demanded of him,
What was best to be done?</p>

<p>Who answered, That if the Carrack were not boarded;
she would recover the shore, and fire herself, as the other
had done.</p>

<p>Whereupon Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span> concluded to entangle
her: and Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Cross</span> promised also to fasten himself
[in the <i>Foresight</i>] to her together at the instant. Which was
performed.</p>

<p>But, after a while, Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>['s ship, the
<i>Roebuck</i>,] receiving a shot, with a cannon perier, under
water, and [being] ready to sink; [he] desired Sir <span class="smcap">Robert
Crosse</span> to fall off that he might also clear himself, and
save his ship from sinking: which with difficulty he did.
For both the <i>Roebuck</i> and the <i>Foresight</i> were so entangled
as, with much ado, could they clear themselves.</p>

<p>The same evening, Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Crosse</span> (finding the
Carrack then sure, and drawing near the Island) persuaded
his company to board her again; or else there was no
hope to recover her: who, after many excuses and fears,
were by him encouraged. And so [his ship] fell athwart
her foreships all alone; and so hindered her sailing, that
the rest had time to come up to his succour, and to recover
the Carrack ere she recovered the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Madre de
Dios</i> taken.</div>

<p>And so, towards the evening, after he had fought with
her alone three hours singly, my Lord of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>'s
two ships [the <i>Tiger</i> and the <i>Sampson</i>] came up:
and, with very little loss, [they] entered with
Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Crosse</span>; who had, in that time, broken
their courage, and made the assault easy for the rest.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The General [Sir <span class="smcap">John Burrough</span>] having disarmed the
Portugals; and stowed them, for better security, on all
sides [<i>i.e. in the various English ships</i>]; first had presented to
his eyes, the true proportion of the vast body of this
Carrack; which did then, and may still, justly provoke the
admiration [<i>wonderment</i>] of all men not formerly acquainted
with such a sight.</p>

<p>But albeit this first appearance of the hugeness thereof

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>

yielded sights enough to entertain our men's eyes; yet the
pitiful object of so many bodies slain and dismembered could
not but draw each man's eye to see, and heart to lament, and
hands to help, those miserable people; whose limbs were so
torn with the violence of shot, and pain made grievous with
the multitude of wounds. No man could almost step but upon
a dead carcase, or a bloody floor. But especially about the
helm; where very many of them fell suddenly from stirring
[<i>steering</i>] to dying. For the greatness of the stirrage
[<i>steering</i>] requiring the labour of twelve or fourteen men at
once; and some of our ships, beating her in at the stern
with their ordnance, oftentimes with one shot slew four
or five labouring on either side of the helm: whose rooms
being still furnished with fresh supplies, and our artillery
still playing upon them with continual vollies; it could
not be but that much blood should be shed in that
place.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exceeding
humanity
showed to the
Enemy.</div>

<p>Whereupon our General, moved with singular commiseration
of their misery, sent them his own
chirurgions, denying them no possible help or
relief he, or any of his Company, could afford
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the rest of those, whose state this chance had
made very deplorable, was Don <span class="smcap">Fernando de Mendoza</span>,
Grand Captain and Commander of this Carrack: who
indeed was descended of the House of <span class="smcap">Mendoza</span> in Spain;
but, being married into Portugal, lived there as one of
that nation. A Gentleman well stricken in years, well
spoken, of comely personage, of good stature: but of hard
fortune.</p>

<p>In his several Services against the Moors, he was twice
taken prisoner; and both times ransomed by the King [of
Spain].</p>

<p>In a former voyage of return from [<i>or rather</i>, going
to] the East India, he was driven [in August 1585] upon the
<i>baxos</i> or "sands of India" [<i>now called</i> Bassas da India, <i>and
situated midway between Africa and Madagascar</i>], near the
coast of Cephala [<i>Sofala</i>]; being then also Captain of a
Carrack [the <i>San Jago</i>], which was there lost: and himself,
though escaping the sea danger, yet fell into the hands

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>

of infidels on land, who kept him under long and grievous
servitude. [<i>An account of this shipwreck will be found in
Vol. III., pp.</i> 25, 311-316.] Once more the King [<span class="smcap">Philip</span>
II.], carrying a loving respect to the man and desirous to
better his condition, was content to let him try his fortune
in this Easterly Navigation; and committed unto him the
conduct of this Carrack [the <i>Madre de Dios</i>], wherein he
went [in 1591] from Lisbon, General of the whole Fleet:
and in that degree had returned, if the Viceroy of Goa, embarked
for Portugal on the <i>Buen Jesus</i>, had not, by reason of
his late Office, being preferred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, intending not to add too much affliction
to the afflicted, moved with pity and compassion of human
misery, in the end, resolved freely to dismiss this Captain
and the most part of his followers to their own
country; and for the same purpose, bestowed them in
certain vessels, furnished with all kinds of necessary provision.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>This business thus dispatched, good leisure had he to
take such [a] view of the goods as conveniency might
afford. And having very prudently, to cut off the unprofitable
spoil and pillage whereunto he saw the minds
of many inclined, seized upon the whole to Her Majesty's
use; after a short and slender rummaging and searching
of such things as first came to hand: he perceived that
the wealth would arise nothing disanswerable to expectation;
but that the variety and grandeur of all
rich commodities would be more than sufficient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
content both the Adventurers' desire and the soldiers'
travail.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here I cannot but enter into the consideration and
acknowledgment of GOD's great favour towards our nation;
who, by putting this purchase [<i>booty</i>] into our hands, hath
manifestly discovered those secret trades and Indian riches
which hitherto lay strangely hidden and cunningly concealed
from us: whereof there was, among some few of us, some
small and unperfect glimpse only; which now is turned into
the broad light of full and perfect knowledge. Whereby it
should seem that the will of GOD for our good is, if our
weakness could apprehend it, to have us communicate with
them in those East Indian treasures: and, by the erection of
a lawful Traffic, to better our means to advance true religion
and his holy service. [<i>Just at the time <span class="smcap">Richard Hakluyt</span>
printed this, 1600 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>; he and others were chartered by Queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, as the English East India Company.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Carrack, being in burden, by the estimation of the wise
and experienced, [of] no less than 1,600 tons; had fully 900
of those, stowed with the gross bulk of merchandise: the
rest of the tonnage being allowed, partly to the ordnance,
which were 32 pieces of brass of all sorts; partly to the
passengers and the victuals; which could not be any small

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>

quantity, considering the number of the persons, betwixt
600 and 700, and the length of the navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A brief Catalogue
of the
sundry rich
commodities
of the <i>Madre
de Dios</i>.</div>

<p>To give you a taste, as it were, of the commodities, it shall
suffice to deliver you a general particularity of
them, according to the Catalogue taken at Leaden
Hall, the 15th of September 1592. Where, upon
good view, it was found that the principal wares,
after the jewels (which were no doubt of great value, though
they never came to light), consisted of <i>Spices</i>, <i>Drugs</i>, <i>Silks</i>,
<i>Calicoes</i>, <i>Quilts</i>, <i>Carpets</i>, and <i>Colours</i>,&amp;c.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i>Spices</i> were Pepper, Cloves, Maces, Nutmegs,
Cinnamon, Green Ginger.</p>

<p>The <i>Drugs</i> were Benjamin [<i>the gum Benzoin</i>], Frankincense,
Galingale [<i>or Galangal</i>], Mirabolams, Aloes,
Zocotrina, Camphor.</p>

<p>The <i>Silks</i> [were] Damasks, Taffatas, Sarcenets, <i>Altobassos</i>
that is counterfeit Cloth of Gold, unwrought China
Silk, Sleaved Silk, White twisted Silk, Curled Cypress
[=<i>Cypress lawn, a cobweb lawn or crape</i>].</p>

<p>The <i>Calicoes</i> were Book Calicoes, Calico Lawns, Broad
white Calicoes, Fine starched Calicoes, Coarse white
Calicoes, Brown broad Calicoes, Brown coarse Calicoes.</p>

<p>There were also Canopies, and coarse Diaper Towels;
<i>Quilts</i> of coarse Sarcenet, and of Calico; <i>Carpets</i> like
those of Turkey.</p>

<p>Whereunto are to be added the Pearls, Musk, Civet,
and Ambergris.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rest of the wares were many in number; but less in
value: as Elephants' teeth; Porcelain vessels of China;
Cocoanuts; Hides; Ebony wood, as black as jet; Bedsteads
of the same; Cloth of the rinds of trees, very strange
for the matter, and artificial in workmanship.</p>

<p>All which piles of commodities being, by men of approved
judgment, rated but in reasonable sort, amounted to no less
than &pound;150,000 sterling [=&pound;600,000 <i>to</i> &pound;700,000 <i>now</i>]: which
being divided among the Adventurers whereof Her Majesty
was the chief, was sufficient to yield contentment to all
parties.</p>

<p>The [above] cargazon [<i>cargo</i>] being taken out [at Dartmouth],
and the goods freighted in ten of our ships, [and]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
sent for London; to the end that the bigness, height, length,
breadth, and other dimensions, of so huge a vessel might, by
the exact rules of geometrical observations, be truly taken,
both for present knowledge and derivation [<i>transmission</i>]
also of the same unto posterity: one Master <span class="smcap">Robert

nothing in the description which either his art could demonstrate;

whereupon was erected a lantern, to contain 165
feet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The breadth, in the second Close deck, whereof
she had three; this being the place where was most
extension of breadth, was 46 feet 10 inches.</p>

<p>She drew in water 31 feet at her departure from
Cochin in India: but not above 26 [feet] at her arrival
in Dartmouth; being lightened in her voyage, by divers
means, some 5 feet.</p>

<p>She carried in height, seven several stories [or decks]:
one main Orlop, three Close decks, one Fore-castle, and
a Spar deck of two floors apiece.</p>

<p>The length of the keel was 100 feet: of the Mainmast
121 feet; and the circuit about, at the partners, 10 feet,
7 inches.</p>

<p>The main-yard was 106 feet long.</p></blockquote>

<p>The directions were sent to us to Plymouth; and we were
to open them at sea.</p>

<p>The 6th of April 1594, we set sail in the Sound of Plymouth,
directing our course toward the Coast of Spain.</p>

<p>The 24th of the said month, at the Admiral's direction;
we divided ourselves East and West from each other, being
then in the height of 43&deg; [North]: with commandment at
night to come together again.</p>

<p>The 27th, in the morning, we descried the <i>May Flower</i>
and the little Pinnace [the <i>Violet</i>] with a prize that they had
taken; being of Vianna [do Castello] in Portugal, and bound
for Angola in Africa. This Bark was of 28 tons; having
some 17 persons in the same. There were in her, some 12

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>

butts of Galicia wine; whereof we took into every ship a like

part: with some Rusk in chests and barrels, with
5 butts of blue coarse cloth, and certain coarse
linen cloth for Negroes' shirts; which goods were divided
among our Fleet.</p>

<p>The 4th of May, we had sight of our Pinnace and the
Admiral's shallop: which had taken three Portugal Caravels;
whereof they had sent two away, and kept the third.</p>

<p>The 2nd of June, we had sight of St. Michael, [one of the

<p>The 3rd day, in the morning, we sent our small Pinnace,
which was of some 24 tons, with the small Caravel which we
had taken at the Burlings, to range the road[s] [<i>harbours</i>] of
all the Islands; to see if they could get anything in the
same: appointing them to meet us W.S.W. 12 leagues from
Fayal. Their going from us was to no purpose. They
missed coming to us, when we appointed: also we missed
them, when we had great cause to have used them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 13th of June, we met with a mighty Carrack of the
East Indies, called <i>Las Cinque Llagas</i>, or <i>The Five Wounds</i>.
The <i>May Flower</i> was in fight with her before night. I, in
the <i>Sampson</i>, fetched her up in the evening; and (as I commanded
to give her the broad side, as we term it) while I
stood very heedfully prying to discover her strength; and
where I might give counsel to board her in the night, when
the Admiral came [<i>should come</i>] up to us; and, as I remember,
at the very first shot she discharged at us, I was shot in a
little above the belly; whereby I was made unserviceable for
a good while after, without [the Portuguese] touching [<i>hurting</i>]
any other for that night.</p>

<p>Yet, by means of an honest true-hearted man which I had
with me, one Captain <span class="smcap">Grant</span>, nothing was neglected.</p>

<p>Until midnight, when the Admiral came up; the <i>May
Flower</i> and the <i>Sampson</i> never left, by turns, to ply her with
their great ordnance: but then Captain <span class="smcap">Cave</span> wished us to
stay till morning; at what time each one of us should give
her three bouts with our great ordnance, and so should clap
her aboard.</p>

<p>But indeed it was long lingered in the morning, until ten
of the clock, before we attempted to board her. The Admiral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
laid her aboard in the mid ship: the <i>May Flower</i> coming up
in the quarter, as it should seem, to lie at the stern of the
Admiral on the larboard side.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">William Anthonie</span>] the Captain of the said <i>May
Flower</i> was slain at the first coming up: whereby the ship
fell to the stern of the out-licar of the Carrack; which, being
a piece of timber, so wounded her Foresail, that they said
they could come no more to [the] fight. I am sure they did
not; but kept aloof from us.</p>

<p>The <i>Sampson</i> were aboard on the bow [of the Carrack];
but having not room enough, our quarter lay on the [<i>Royal</i>]
<i>Exchange</i>'s and our bow on the Carrack's bow.</p>

<p>The <i>Exchange</i> also, at the first coming, had her Captain,
Master <span class="smcap">[George] Cave</span>, shot in both the legs; the one
whereof he never recovered: so he, for that present, was not
able to do his office; and, in his absence, he had not any
that would undertake to lead out his Company to enter upon
the Enemy.</p>

<p>My friend, Captain <span class="smcap">Grant</span>, did lead my men on the Carrack's
side; which, being not manfully backed by the <i>Exchange</i>'s
men, his forces being small, made the Enemy bolder
than he would have been: whereby I had six men presently
slain, and many more hurt; which made them that remained
unhurt to return aboard, and [they] would never more give
the assault. I say not but some of the <i>Exchange</i>'s men did
very well: and many more, no doubt, would have done the
like, if there had been any principal man to have put them
forward, and to have brought all the Company to the fight;
and not to have run into corners themselves. But I must
needs say that their ship [<i>the Carrack</i>] was as well provided
for defence as any that I have seen.</p>

<p>And the Portugals, peradventure encouraged by our slack
working, played the men; and had Barricadoes made where
they might stand without any danger of our shot. They
plied us also very much with fire, so that most of our men
were burnt in some place or other: and while our men were
putting out the fire, they would ever be plying them with
small shot or darts. This unusual casting of fire did much
dismay many of our men, and made them draw back as
they did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had not men to enter; we plied our great
ordnance much at them, as high up as they might be
mounted: for otherwise we did them little harm. And by
shooting a piece out of our forecastle, being close by her, we
fired a mat on her beak-head: which [fire] more and more
kindled, and ran from thence to the mat on the bowsprit;
and from the mat, up to the wood of the bowsprit; and
thence to the topsail-yard; which fire made the Portugals
abaft in the ship to stagger, and to make show of <i>parl&eacute;</i>. But
they that had the charge before, encouraged them; making
show that it might easily be put out, and that it was nothing.
Whereupon again they stood stiffly to their defence.</p>

<p>Anon the fire grew so strong that I saw it [to be] beyond
all help; although she had been already yielded to us.
Then we desired to be off from her, but had little hope to
[have] obtained our desire. Nevertheless we plied water
very much to keep our ship well. Indeed I made little other
reckoning for the ship, myself, and divers hurt men; [but]
then to have ended there with the Carrack: but most of our
people might have saved themselves in boats. And when
my care was most, by GOD's Providence only, by the burning
asunder of our spritsail-yard with [its] ropes and sail,
and the ropes about the spritsail-yard of the Carrack,
whereby we were fast entangled, we fell apart; with [the]
burning of some of our sails which we had then on board.</p>

<p>The <i>Exchange</i> also, being further from the fire, afterward
was more easily cleared; and fell off from abaft.</p>

<p>As soon as GOD had put us out of danger, the fire got
into the Fore-castle [of the Carrack]; where, I think, was
store of Benjamin [<i>the gum Benzoin</i>] and such other like
combustible matter: for it flamed and ran all over the Carrack
in an instant, in a manner. The Portugals leapt overboard
in great numbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then sent I, Captain <span class="smcap">Grant</span> with the boat; with leave to
use his own discretion in saving of them. So he brought
me aboard two Gentlemen:</p>

<p>The one, an old man, called <span class="smcap">Nuno Velio Pereira</span> which,
as appeareth by the Fourth Chapter in the First Book of the
worthy <i>History</i> of <span class="smcap">[Jan] Huyghen van Linschoten</span>, was
Governor of Mozambique and Cefala [<i>Sofala</i>] in the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
1582 [See <i>English Garner</i> III, 27, 28.]: and since that time,
had been likewise a Governor in a place of importance in
the East Indies. And the ship [<i>a Carrack</i>], wherein he was
coming home, was cast away a little to the east of the Cape
of <i>Buona Speranza</i> [Cape of Good Hope]: and from thence,
he travelled overland to Mozambique; and came, as a passenger,
in this Carrack.</p>

<p>The other was called <span class="smcap">Bras Carrero</span>, and [he] was Captain
of a Carrack which was cast away near Mozambique; and
[he] came likewise in this ship for a passenger.</p>

<p>Also three men of the inferior sort we saved in our boat.
Only these two we clothed, and brought into England. The
rest, which were taken up by the other ships' boats, we set
all on shore in the Isle of Flores: except some two or three
Negroes; whereof one was born in the Mozambique, and
another in the East Indies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This fight was open off the Sound between Fayal and
Pico; six leagues to the southward.</p>

<p>The people which we saved told us, That the cause why
they would not yield was because this Carrack was for the
King; and that she had all the goods belonging to the King
in the country [<i>India</i>] for that year in her; and that the
Captain of her was in favour with the King; and at his [next]
return into the Indies, should have been Viceroy there.</p>

<p>And withal this ship was nothing at all pestered; neither
within board, nor without: and was more like a Ship of War
than otherwise. Moreover, she had the ordnance of a
Carrack that was cast away at Mozambique, and the [Ship's]
Company of her: together with the [Ship's] Company of
another Carrack that was cast away a little to the eastward
of the Cape of <i>Buona Speranza</i>. Yet through sickness,
which they caught at Angola, where they watered; they
said, They had not now above 150 white men: but negroes,
a great many.</p>

<p>They likewise affirmed that they had three Noblemen and
three Ladies in her: but we found them to differ in most of
their talk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All this day [14th June 1594] and all the night she
burned: but, next morning, her powder, which was lowest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
being 60 barrels, blew her abroad; so that most of the ship
did swim in parts above the water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some of them say, That she was bigger than the <i>Madre
de Dios</i>; and some, That she was less. But she was much
undermasted, and undersailed [<i>carrying too little sail</i>]: yet
she went well for a ship that was so foul.</p>

<p>The shot which we [in the <i>Samson</i>] made at her in great
ordnance, before we lay her aboard, might be at seven bouts
[<i>broadsides</i>] which we had, and 6 or 7 shot at a bout, one
with another, some 49 shots. The time we lay aboard [the
Carrack] might be two hours. The shot which we discharged
[while] aboard the Carrack, might be [that of] some
24 sakers.</p>

<p>And thus much may suffice concerning our dangerous
conflict with that unfortunate Carrack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last of June [1594], after long traversing of the seas,
we had sight of another mighty Carrack; which divers of
our Company, at the first, took to be the great <i>San Philip</i>,
the Admiral [<i>or Flag Ship</i>] of Spain; but the next day,
being the 1st of July [1594], fetching her up, we perceived
her indeed to be a Carrack: which, after some few shot
bestowed upon her, we summoned to yield; but they, standing
stoutly to their defence, utterly refused the same.</p>

<p>Wherefore, seeing no good could be done without boarding
her, I consulted what course we should take in the
boarding. But by reason that we, which were the chief
Captains, were partly slain, and partly wounded, in the
former conflict; and because of the murmuring of some
disordered and cowardly companions: our valiant and
resolute determinations were crossed. And, to conclude
a long discourse in few words, the Carrack escaped our
hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this, attending about Corvo and Flores for some
West Indian purchase [<i>booty</i>], and being disappointed of
our expectation; and victuals growing short, we returned
to England: where I arrived at Portsmouth, the 28th of
August [1594].</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap"><b>Footnotes</b></span></p>
<div class="footnote">

By noon, or one of the clock, of that day, being the 3rd of August
[1592], the <i>Dainty</i> came near her so that the Gunner, whose name was
<span class="smcap">Thomas Bedome</span> (being a proper tall man: and had very good aim at
anything, and good luck withal), desired the Captain [<span class="smcap">Thomson</span>] he
might give them a shoot: to let them understand that they were
Englishmen; and, under Her Highness, Commanders of the Seas.
</p>
<p>
The Captain (having great care; and not willing to have any
shoot shot in vain) commanded him to forbear till they should come
nearer her; which was not long: when the Captain commanded him
to do his best; and carousing a can of wine to his Company, encouraged
them to begin the fight.
</p>
<p>
And coming up, [he] hailed them, after the manner of the sea; and
commanded them to strike for the Queen of England: which they no
sooner refused, but the Gunner, being ready, gave fire to two whole
culverins in her chase; and racked and tore her pitifully.
</p>
<p>
Bearing up with them, [we] gave them the whole [broad] side; and
boarded them presently: who resisted most courageously, and put us
off again.
</p>
<p>
Thus continued the <i>Dainty</i> in fight a pretty while before any others
could come to help her.
</p>
<p>
In which time, she laid her aboard three several times, tore her
Ancient [<i>Flag</i>] from her Poop, and slew her Captain [?]. And more
harm had done them: but that, by chance, a shot bare their Foremast
by the board; which they were compelled to splice again, to their great
trouble.

The next was Her Majesty's good Ship, the <i>Foresight</i>; whose
Commander for that Service was Captain [Sir <span class="smcap">Robert</span>]
<span class="smcap"> Crosse</span> (a man well approved in marine causes,
and far hath adventured): who with his ship laid her aboard, and very
valiantly assailed them; and was most stoutly by the Spaniards also repulsed.</p>

<p>Insomuch that the brave Captain, of whose men, many were weak;
and yet being loath Her Majesty's Ship should be shaken off without
victory, fired the Carrack: rather wishing her to be burnt, than the
enemies to enjoy her. But the proud and lofty-minded Spaniards,
standing on their resolute points, returned the fire again, or some other:
which three times was kindled [on board the <span class="smcap">Foresight</span>]; to the great
cumber of Captain <span class="smcap">Crosse</span> and his Company, that would not so leave
them.
</p>
<p>
This dangerous conflict between these ships endured [a] long
time. Which the <i>Phœnix</i> of Portsmouth perceiving...being of 60
tons or thereabouts...left her for a time; standing with their
Admiral and Vice-Admiral, which were the <i>Tiger</i> and the <i>Sampson</i>:
and coming up with them, declared unto them the hardy fight of the
<i>Foresight</i>; who presently bare up with them all the night. The
<i>Sampson</i>, being the first, coming up with the Carrack, gave her the
whole broadside: and shutting up into the <i>Foresight</i>'s quarter, entered
his men into her.
</p>
<p>
Captain <span class="smcap">Norton</span>, that brave and worthy Gentleman, laid her also
aboard, having the <i>Tiger</i> with him.
</p>
<p>
And so [all three crews] entered together, being 100 men at the
least, all resolutely minded. At whose entrance they yielded so great a
cry as the dismayed Portugals and Spaniards could not bethink themselves
what course to take to help themselves: in such a maze were
they stricken, although they were [originally] 800 strong, all well-appointed
and able men; and of ours but 100. But standing thus, as
men amazed, at length [they] yielded themselves vanquished.

They gan to consult, What were best to do with the prisoners,
which were many? And finding their great scarcity of victuals; and
not knowing what weather they might have; nor how it might please
GOD with good wind to prosper them: it was concluded to ship as
many of them as they might; and to send them for Lisbon. This they
fully determined; and provision was made of a Bark of Dover, which
they met: the Fleet taking in her men, and such provision as they had
in her; and embarked the Spaniards and Portingals, with their Negroes,
whereof were many. And gave them, with them, store of victuals; and
so gave them leave to depart; detaining none but the principalest of
them.

The conflict ended, it were a world of wonder to recount unto you
the true reports, how our men bestirred themselves in searching and
prying into every corner of her as far as they might: as they might well
do, having with so great danger overcome her. The sight of the
riches, within the same contained, did so amaze the Companies (that
were within board of her: and that still came from every ship; being
desirous to see what GOD had sent them, after so long and hot a fight)
that many of them could not tell what to take; such was the store and
goodness thereof.
</p>
<p>
Yea, he that had known what [the] things had been worth, in a little
room might have contrived great wealth. For it is credibly reported
that some younkers happened to find many Jars of Civet, which is of
great worth; and [it having been] of some long time closely kept was
cause, when they opened the same, it yielded no savour: and they,
ignorant and not knowing what it should be, thinking it but trash, as it
came to their hands, heaved it overboard. Many other things were so
spoiled [<i>destroyed</i>] for want of knowledge; when every man had
sufficient, and that not one had cause to complain.

few Toys of mine own travail: [the] most part
conceived in Italy, and some of them brought
forth in England. By which my imperfections,
you may see, as in a lively mirror, your own
perfections; and by the follies of my rechlesse [<i>heedless</i>]
youth, behold plainly the virtues of your flowering age:
hoping your Ladyship will keep them as privately, as I
send them unto you most willingly.</p>

<p>Neither doubt I at all but that your excellent spirit will
judge graciously of this my bare, yet bounden, conceit; and
to accept the same, as a mean[s], at idle times, to drive
away that self-pleasing, yet ill-easing, humour of never-glad
melancholy, which spiteful Fortune, seeking (though in vain)
most injuriously to insult over you, laboureth by all means
possible to inflict upon you: the virtuous behaviour of yourself
being such as, even in the midst of all your crosses, you
cross her designs with an invincible heart, and with your
honourable carriage carry her, with all her devices, as a slave
to follow you, in all your generous and thrice-noble actions;
maugre the intricate labyrinth of so many and infinite
troubles allotted, most unworthily, unto you, by the irrevocable
doom of your too partial and flinty Destiny. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
which notwithstanding, you bear and over-bear, with a
most resolute staiedness; and a resolved courage of a right
PERCY, and of a mind <i>A per se</i>.</p>

<p>But additions breed suspicions; and fair words, for the
most part are counted the blazons of flattery: therefore I
will leave to the temperate judgment of the wise, and to
the uncorrupt censure of the worthier sort, your heroical
and undaunted mind; and the integrity and never-stained
proceedings of your spotless self.</p>

<p>Only this, with submission, will I say, that if the richness
of the ground is known by the corn; the daintiness of the
water, by the sweetness of the fish; and the goodness of the

a guess of the internal habit and excellent qualities of your
inward mind, by the outward behaviour and apparent semblance
of your exceeding chaste, and more than admirable,
demeanour in every respect.</p>

<p>And thus, hoping your Honour will as debonairly accept
of these Trifles, as I dutifully bequeath them unto you;

deign to read these few lines: craving both privilege, and

<blockquote>
<p>[The unique copy of this Tract is preserved in the Advocates' Library
at Edinburgh. As it is however, somewhat confusedly written; its
information has been corrected and completed from other contemporary
sources.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#10013;This is quite incorrect. The following is a truer account:</p>

<p>On Sunday, being the 30th of July, 1587, in the 29th year of the reign
of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> the Queen's Majesty of England, there went from Peterborough
Master <span class="smcap">William Dethick</span>, <i>alias</i> Garter Principal King of
Arms, and five Heralds, accompanied by 40 horse and men, to conduct
the body of <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, late Queen of Scots, from Fotheringhay Castle in
Northamptonshire (which Queen had remained prisoner in England
nineteen years): having for that purpose, brought a royal coach drawn
by four horses, and covered with black velvet; richly set forth with
escutcheons of the Arms of Scotland, and little pennons round about it.
</p>
<p>
The body (being enclosed in lead; and the same coffined in wood)
was brought down, and reverently put into the coach.
</p>
<p>
At which time, the Heralds put on their Coats of Arms, and bare-headed,
with torches' light, brought the same forth of the Castle, about
ten of the clock at night: and so conveyed it to Peterborough [eleven]
miles distant from Fotheringhay Castle.
</p>
<p>
Whither being come, about two of the clock on the Monday morning
[31st July]; the body was received most reverently at the Minster Door
of Peterborough, by the Bishop, Dean and Chapter, and [<span class="smcap">Robert
Cooke</span>] <i>Clarenceux</i> King at Arms.
</p>
<p>
And, in the presence of the Scots which came with the same, it was
laid in a Vault prepared for the same, in the Quire of the said Church,
on the south side; opposite to the tomb of Queen <span class="smcap">Katharine</span> [of
Arragon], Dowager of Spain, the first wife of King <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the Eighth.
</p>
<p>
The occasion why the body was forthwith laid into the Vault, and not
borne in the Solemnity; was because it was so extreme[ly] heavy, by
reason of the lead, that the Gentlemen could not have endured to have
carried it, with leisure, in the solemn proceeding: and besides, [it] was
feared that the solder might rip; and, [it] being very hot weather, might
be found some annoyance.

<p>The following additional details are given in the Account drawn up

<p>The body, with the closures, weighed nine hundred weight; which
being carried, and attended orderly by the said persons, was committed
to the ground in the Vault appointed: and immediately the Vault was
covered, saving a small hole left open for the Staffs to [be] broken into.</p>

<p>There were at that time, not any Offices of the Church Service done:
the Bishop being ready to have executed therein. But it was by all that
were present, as well Scottish as others, thought good and agreed, that
it should be done at the day and time of Solemnity.]</p>

which were all covered with velvet, were fixed Scutcheons:
bearing either [the] Red Lion alone; or else parted with the

<p>On Tuesday, being the 1st of August, in the morning,
about eight of the clock, the Chief Mourner, being [<span class="smcap">Bridget
Russell</span>] the Countess of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> [<i>now the Widow of her

Ladies; and brought into the Presence Chamber within the
Bishop's Palace: which [Chamber], all over, was hanged
with black cloth.</p>

<p>She was, by the Queen's Majesty's Gentlemen Ushers,
placed somewhat under a Cloth of Estate [<i>canopy</i>] of purple
velvet: where, (having given to the [<i>Gentlemen representing,
on this occasion, the</i>] Great Officers, their Staffs of Office (viz.
to the Lord Steward; Lord Chamberlain; the Treasurer,
and Comptroller [of the Household]), she took her way into
the Great Hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><i>A Remembrance of the Order, &amp;c.</i> <i>Archæologia</i>, I., 155 [for 355],

<p>The Mourners came out of the Bishop's Palace; being set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
in order by the Heralds thus:</p>

<p>First 100 Releevants; poor old women, for the most part
widows: in black cloth gowns, with an ell of white holland
over their heads; which they had for their labour, and nine
shillings apiece in money. These divided themselves in the
body of the Church; and stood half on the one side, and
half on the other: and there stood during the whole
Solemnity.</p>

<p>At the Church door, the Singing Men and Quiristers met
the Mourners with a <i>Psalm</i>; and led them the way into
the Chancel, continuing singing, with the Organ, until the
Sermon began.</p>

<p>Then followed two Yeomen, viz.: the Sheriff [of Northamptonshire]'s
Bailiff and the Bailiff of Peterborough; with black
staves.</p>

<p>And after them [100 poor men, in] Mourning Coats.</p>

<p>Then Sir <span class="smcap">George Savile</span>, in a Mourning gown, carrying
the great Standard: viz. a Cross on a Field azure; the
Streamer, a Unicorn argent in a Field of guiles; a Posy
written, <i>In my defence, GOD me defend!</i></p>

<p>Then followed Mourning Cloaks, two by two, a great
number: whereof the first were the late Queen's Officers.</p>

<p>And after them, Mourning Gowns.</p>

<p>Among these Officers of her House was [Monsieur <span class="smcap">du
Preau</span>] a French Jesuit, her Confessor, with a golden
crucifix about his neck; which he did wear openly: and
being told, That the people murmured and disliked at it;
he said, He would do it, though he died for it. Thus we
may see how obdurate their hearts are in malice; and how
obstinate they shew themselves in the vain toys and superstitious
trifles of their own imaginations.</p>

<p>Then [<span class="smcap">Richard Fletcher</span>] the Dean [of Peterborough].</p>

<p>Next the two Bishops: [<span class="smcap">Richard Howland</span>] of
<span class="smcap">Peterborough</span>, and [<span class="smcap">William Wickham</span>, of] <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>.</p>

Officers in her [<i>Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s</i>] House.</p>

<p>Then Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew Noel</span> alone, carrying the Banner of
Scotland.</p>

<p>Then [<span class="smcap">William</span>, <i>afterwards</i> Sir <span class="smcap">William, Segar</span>] Percullis
the Herald [<i>Portcullis Pursuivant</i>] bearing the Crown

with a Gentleman at Arms [<i>or rather, a Gentleman
Usher</i>].</p>

<p>Then followed the Coffin [<i>empty of course</i>], covered with
a pall of velvet; six Scutcheons fixed thereon, upon the head
whereof stood a Crown of Gold.</p>

<p>Six Gentlemen bare [<i>the supposed</i>] corpse, under a velvet

<p>Eight Banerols [<i>a Banner, about a yard square, borne at

<p>The ten Scottish and French Women of the [late] Queen's
[Household]: with black attire on their heads, of Taffaty

Hoods.</p>

<p>They, with the Scottish and French men, did all go out
before the Sermon, except <span class="smcap">Master Melvin</span> [i.e. <span class="smcap">Andrew

<p>The Head Mourner and the [twelve] Ladies, with the two
Earls assistant were placed within the Hearse [<i>or Catafalque</i>].</p>

<p>The two Knights, with their Banners, were set at the East
end of the Hearse, without the pale: and the eight Squires,
with their Bannerols, four of a side, in like manner without
the pale.</p>

<p>All the rest of the Mourners were carried up by a Herald
above the Hearse; and placed of each side, the women next
the altar.</p>

<p>The Bishop and the Dean [of Peterborough] stood at the
altar, with two gilded basons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All which being placed and set, and the Church quiet;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
[<span class="smcap">William Wickham</span>,] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> began his
Sermon [out of <i>Psalm</i> xxxix. 5-7].<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>And in his prayer [when he gave thanks for such as
were translated out of this Vale of Misery, he] used these
words:</p>

<p>"Let us bless GOD for the happy dissolution of <span class="smcap">Mary</span>,
late the Scottish Queen and Dowager of France. Of whose
life and departure, whatsoever shall be expected, I have
nothing to say: for that I was unacquainted with the one;
and not present at the other. Of Her Majesty's faith and
end, I am not to judge. It is a charitable saying of the
Father <span class="smcap">Luther</span> 'Many [a] one liveth a Papist; and dieth a
Protestant.' Only this I have been informed, That she took
her death patiently; and recommended herself wholly to
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Sermon ended, a long piece of velvet and a cushion
were carried and laid before the Countess [of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>], to
go and kneel upon; hard before the Bishop [of <span class="smcap">Peterborough</span>]'s
feet.</p>

<p>Then, by [Garter,] the King of Heralds, were carried the
four Officers with their White Staffs; and placed two at
the top of the stairs under the Bishop, and two beneath
them.</p>

<p>Then the two principal Heralds [Garter and <i>Clarenceux</i>]
fetched up the Countess; the two Earls [of <span class="smcap">Rutland</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>] leading her, and the Lady St. <span class="smcap">John</span> [of Basing]
bearing up her train.</p>

<p>There she kneeled awhile.</p>

<p>And then all returned to their places.</p>

<p>This was the First Offering [for Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>].</p>

<p>Not[e] that <span class="smcap">Brakenbury</span> went this time before her [<i>the
Countess of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span></i>].</p>

<p>The two Earls [were] placed without the pale [of the
Hearse], before the Countess.</p>

<p>One of the Kings of Heralds fetched from the Hearse, the
Coat Armour; brought it down to the other King of Heralds;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and he delivered it to the two Earls. They carried it,
obeisance being done to the Countess, to the Bishop [of
<span class="smcap">Peterborough</span>]; and kissed it in delivering of it. A third
Herald took it of the Bishop; and laid it down on the
altar.</p>

<p>The Sword, the Target, the Helmet, Crown, and Crest, in
like sort was all done by the two Earls: kissing their hands
before them.</p>

<p>Then were the two Banners carried, by one after another,
severally by those that brought them; and so set upon the
altar, leaning to the wall.</p>

<p>The other eight Bannerols were put into the Hearse as
they stood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then went the Countess [of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>], Master <span class="smcap">John
Manners</span> [acting as Vice Chamberlain,] holding up her
train the second time; and offered alone [for herself] to the
Bishop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the Ladies and Gentlemen, by two and two, went
up and offered.</p>

<p>Then the [four] Officers with White Staffs offered.</p>

<p>And, last of all, came there a Herald to the pulpit; and
fetched the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>.</p>

<p>And then the most part of the Mourners departed, in the
same order they came in: and towards the door of the
Chancel, stood the Scottish women, parted on both sides; and
as the English Ladies passed, they kissed them all.</p>

<p>Then over the Vault, where the body lay; [<span class="smcap">Richard
Fletcher</span>] the Dean [of Peterborough] read the ordinary
words of [the] Burial [Service].</p>

<p>And this being done: the four Officers brake their White
Staffs over their heads; and threw them into the Vault.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:0.2em;">IN the year 1582, departing the English</span>
coast toward[s] the end of May, in a ship
of London called the <i>Mary Marten</i> (one
of the owners [of which] was a citizen of
London named Master <span class="smcap">Eastwoode</span>; the
other of them, named Master <span class="smcap">Estridge</span>,
dwelling at Limehouse), being laden and
bound for Petrach [<i>Patras</i>], a town of
mart, being within the dominion of the Turk: where we
safely arrived and made our mart.</p>

<p>And within eight and twenty days were laden homeward;
and presently we weighed anchor, and set sail. And coming
out of the Gulf of Lepanto, [we] grounded upon a rock, lying
on the larboard side; being in very great danger, [and] in
doubt to lose both ship and goods: yet it pleased GOD that
we recovered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, about the midst of the month of July [1582],
we came right before Cape de Gatte [<i>Cabo de Gata, near
Almeria, in Spain</i>] when, having a very small wind, we
descried two galleys: whereupon the Master commanded
the Gunner to put forth the ordnance, and to heave the skiff
overboard.</p>

<p>Then did the Gunner demand of the Master to make a
shot: which he granted. Then did he bestow eight and
twenty shot, but to no purpose: for the enemy lay very far
out.</p>

<p>Now when we saw our shot and powder spent so much in
waste, some of our company cried to our Master to shew the
Turks' Letters: but he would not; but commanded the
Gunner still to shoot.</p>

<p>For now the galleys were within shot, and did shoot at us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
both with great shot and muskets. And presently both our
Gunners were slain, both with one shot; and some others
maimed, whereby we were in great doubt: for the gallies
lying on both sides of us, one of them had shot us under
water, whereby our ship was foundered before we perceived.</p>

<p>Then we perceiving the ship to sink from us; such as
were wariest leapt into the skiff, as many as it was able to
bear: the rest leaping overboard, such as could swim saved
themselves, going aboard the gallies; the others were
drowned.</p>

<p>Now I being the last man upon the hatches, because I was
at the stern, and being sore hurt with a musket shot; the
Turks [having] made haste to board our ship, hoping to save
some of our goods: two of them came aboard. The first
came to me, and took me by the bosom. I drew out my
knife very speedily, and thrust him into the body; and so
slew him. The other was gone down into the ship, where I
left him; for even then was the ship sinking from me.</p>

<p>Wherefore I betook myself to swimming; and turning me
about to see the ship, I could see nothing thereof but only
the flag. Then did I swim to the gallies; and laying hold
upon an oar, got into the galley.</p>

<p>When I was aboard, I was stripped of my clothes. Then
presently was I commanded to the poop, to talk with the
Captain: who inquired of me, Whether I was a Merchant
[<i>i.e.</i>, <i>the Supercargo of the ship</i>]? Which because I would
not confess, he gave me 15 strokes with a cudgel, and then
put me in the galley's hold: where I was six days, taking
very little sustenance; lying in extreme pains, by reason of
my hurts which I had received in the fight; and with
anguish, for my hard hap.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About three months after [? <i>October 1582</i>], the gallies
returned to Argire [<i>Algiers</i>]; where immediately after my
landing I was sold for 66 doubles [<i>the Double Pistoles or
Doubloons; equal according to page <a href="#Page_392">392</a> to &pound;4, 14s. then; or
say &pound;20 now</i>].</p>

<p>Then did I fall into extreme sickness for ten days' space;
notwithstanding [which] I was sent to sea by my Master to
whom I was sold, to labour in the gallies at an oar's end:
where I remained three months [? <i>November 1582 to January
</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
<i>1583</i>], being very feeble and weak, by reason my sickness
continued the most part of that time; yet was I constrained
either to labour, or else to lose my head. I had no other
choice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the gallies returning home to Argire <i>[Algiers</i>], after
my coming on shore I was in a marvellous weakness; what
with continual labour, with beating, and with sickness:
which endured three months [? <i>February to April 1583</i>],
being in a most miserable estate without all succour seeing
no man to pity my misery; having no nourishment but only
bread and water and [of] that but small quantity, no apparel
on me but a thin shirt and a pair of linen breeches, and
lodged in a stable on the cold ground. Thus I, being almost
in despair ever to recover, yielded myself to the will of
Almighty GOD; whom it pleased, in the end, to give me a
little strength.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And after, for the space of two [<i>or rather</i> four years] or
more [? <i>April 1583 to April 1587</i>], I was divers times at my
labour at the oar's end, after my accustomed manner; till
(such time our fleet of gallies meeting with the gallies of
Genoa near the Christian shore; and they following us in
chase) it chanced, [<i>about April 1587</i>] by reason of tempest,
that our galley was cast away near the west side of the island
[of] Formentera.</p>

<p>There were in it, of Christians and Turks, to the number
of 250; which were all drowned except 15: of which myself,
with two others, with great difficulty brake our chains; and
taking hold of an oar, we escaped to the shore, not without
great danger of drowning.</p>

<p>We being now gotten to land, and accompanied both with
Turks and Christians; we took our rest under bushes and
thickets. The Turks were very unwilling to depart with
[<i>separate from</i>] us; thinking to find some other galley of the
company to take us aboard, and carry us back to Argire
[<i>Algiers</i>].</p>

<p>But we, hoping now to get our liberties, conveyed ourselves
as secretly as we could into the woods; and went unto a
rock, and with sharp stones we did beat off our irons: and
fled immediately to the Christians, and yielded ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>But one of them which escaped with me, who was born in
Sclavony [? <i>Slavonia, or</i> ? <i>Cephalonia</i>], told them, That I was
an English Lutheran.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then was I presently carried aboard a galley of Genoa,
and put in chains.</p>

<p>And, upon the morrow, was I sent over into the Isle of
Iviza, being within the jurisdiction of Majorca: which are all
in the dominion of Spain.</p>

<p>There was I imprisoned in the High Tower of the Town
Castle [<i>of the town of Iviza</i>], with a pair of bolts upon my
heels, and a clasp of iron about my neck, there hanging a
chain at the clasp: where I remained nine days, fed with a
little bread and water.</p>

<p>Now because I had in no respect offended them; I
demanded, Wherefore they molested me? saying, It was
contrary to [the] law and the profession of Christians.</p>

<p>Then did they ask me, If I had spoken anything against
the King, and against the Church of Rome?</p>

<p>I answered, "Nothing!"</p>

<p>Then they told me, I should be sent to Majorca, to answer
before the Inquisition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the Justice, or Chief Officer, of Iviza brought me
back to Genoa; requesting to have me chained in a galley:
which the Captain did, asking the Justice, Who should be my
surety for running away?</p>

<p>He demanded, If there were not a spare chain?</p>

<p>He said, "Yes." Then he commanded a chain to be brought
forth; and chained me at the sixth oar before: where I
rowed until we came to the Port of Spine [<i>later called</i>
Portpin; <i>now the</i> Bay of Palma] in Majorca, guarding me
with 14 gallies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then were the Officers of the Inquisition sent for by the
Captain, which came the second day after our coming there
[<i>i.e.</i>, <i>to Palma</i>]: and at their coming, they offered me the
<i>Pax</i>, which I refused to touch.</p>

<p>Whereupon they reviled me, and called me "Lutheran!"</p>

<p>[And] taking me presently out of the galley, carried me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
on shore in Majorca: and finding the Inquisitor walking in
the market place, [they] presented me to him, saying, "Here
is the prisoner!"</p>

<p>He immediately commanded me to prison; whither they
carried me, and put a pair of shackles on my heels. Where I
remained two days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then was I brought forth into a church, where the
Inquisitor sat usually in judgement. Who being ready set,
commanded me to kneel down and to do homage to certain
images which were before me.</p>

<p>I told him, "I would not do that which I knew to be
contrary to the commandments of Almighty God; neither
had I been brought up in the Roman law, neither would I
submit myself to it."</p>

<p>He asked me, Why I would not?</p>

<p>I answered, "That whereas in England, where I was born
and brought up, the Gospel was truly preached; and maintained
by a most gracious Princess: therefore I would not
now commit idolatry, which is utterly condemned by the
Word of God."</p>

<p>Then he charged me to utter the truth, otherwise I should
abide the smart.</p>

<p>Then was a stool set, and he commanded me to sit down
before him; and offered me the cross, bidding me reverently
to lay my hand upon it, and urged me instantly to do it:
which moved me so much, that I did spit in the Inquisitor's
face; for which the Scribe gave me a good buffet on the face.</p>

<p>So, for that time, we had no more reasoning. For the
Inquisitor did ring a little bell to call the Keeper; and [he]
carried me to ward again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the third day, I was brought forth again to the place
aforesaid.</p>

<p>Then the Inquisitor asked me, What I had seen in the
churches of England?</p>

<p>I answered, That I had seen nothing in the Church of
England but the Word of God truly preached.</p>

<p>Then he demanded, How I had received the Sacraments?</p>

<p>I replied, That I had received them according to the
institution of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>: that is, I received the bread in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
remembrance that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in the flesh died upon the cross
for the redemption of man.</p>

<p>"How," said he, "hast thou received the wine?"</p>

<p>Whereto I replied and said, That I received the wine in
remembrance that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shed his blood to wash away our
sins.</p>

<p>He said, It was in their manner?</p>

<p>I said, "No."</p>

<p>Then he charged me to speak the truth, or I should die
for it.</p>

<p>I told him, "I did speak the truth; and would speak the
truth: for," said I, "it is better for me to die guiltless than
guilty."</p>

<p>Then did he, with great vehemency, charge me again to
speak the truth; and sware by the Catholic Church of Rome,
that if I did not, I should die in fire.</p>

<p>Then I said, "If I died in the faith which I had confessed,
I should die guiltless:" and told him he had made a vain
oath. And so I willed him to use no circumstance to
dissuade me from the truth: "for you cannot prevail.
Though I be now in your hands, where you have power over
my body; yet have you no power over my soul." I told him,
he made a long matter far from the truth.</p>

<p>For which, he said I should die.</p>

<p>Then he bade me say what I could to save myself.</p>

<p>Where I replied, as followeth: Touching the manner of
the receiving of Sacraments, where he said "it was like to
theirs": "you," said I, "when you receive the bread, say it
is the very body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and likewise you affirm the
wine to be his very blood." Which I denied; saying it was
impossible for a mortal man to eat the material body of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, or to drink his blood.</p>

<p>Then he said, I had blasphemed the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>I answered, That I had said nothing against the true
Catholic Church; but altogether against the false Church.</p>

<p>He asked, How I could prove it? saying if I could not
prove it, I should die a most cruel death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Note, by the way, that when any man is in durance for
religion; he is called to answer before no open assembly:
but only in the presence of the Inquisitor, the Secretary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the Solicitor whom they term the Broker. The cause is, as
I take it, because they doubt [<i>fear</i>] that very many of their
own people would confess the Gospel, if they did but see and
understand their absurd dealing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again, to the matter. Because it was so secret, they
urged me to speak the more.</p>

<p>Then he inquired, Whether I had ever been confessed?</p>

<p>I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>He demanded, "To whom?"</p>

<p>I said, "To GOD."</p>

<p>He asked me, If I had ever confessed to any Friar?</p>

<p>I said, "No, for I do utterly defy them. For how can he
forgive me my sins, which is himself a sinner; as all other
men are."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "he which confesseth himself to a Friar,
who is a Father, may have remission of his sins by his
mediation."</p>

<p>"Which," I said, "I would never believe."</p>

<p>Wherefore seeing they could seduce me, by no means,
to yield to their abominable idolatry; the Secretary cried,
"Away with him!" The Inquisitor and he frowned very
angerly on me for the answers which I had given: and said,
They would make me tell another tale.</p>

<p>So, at the ringing of a little bell, the Keeper came and
carried me to ward again.</p>

<p>At my first Examination, when the Keeper should lead
me away; the Inquisitor did bless me with the cross: but
never after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days after was I brought again, and set upon a stool
before the Inquisitor.</p>

<p>He bade me ask <i>misericordium</i>.</p>

<p>I told him, "I would crave mercy of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> who
died for my sins. Other <i>misericordium</i> would I crave
none!"</p>

<p>Then he commanded me to kneel before the altar.</p>

<p>I said, "I would: but not to pray to any image. For
your altar is adorned with many painted images which were
fashioned by the hands of sinful men: which have mouths,
and speak not; ears, and hear not; noses, and smell not;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not&mdash;which
GOD doth not allow at his altar, for he hath utterly
condemned them by his Word."</p>

<p>Then he said, I had been wrong[ly] taught. "For," said
he, "whosoever shall see these figures in earth may the
better remember him in heaven whose likeness it doth
represent, who would be a Mediator to GOD for us."</p>

<p>But I replied, That all images were an abomination to
the Lord: for he hath condemned them in express words
by his own mouth, saying, "Thou shalt not make thyself any
graven image, &amp;c."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "but we have need of a Mediator to make
intercession for us: for we are unworthy to pray to GOD
ourselves, because we are vile sinners."</p>

<p>I said, "There was no Mediator but <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>."</p>

<p>Where, after many absurd reasons and vain persuasions,
he took a pause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then I asked him, Why he kept me so long in prison,
which never committed offence to them: knowing very well
that I had been captive in Argire [<i>Algiers</i>] near[ly] five
years space [<i>July 1582 to April 1587</i>]: saying, "That when
GOD, by his merciful providence, had, through many great
dangers, set me in a Christian country, and delivered me
from the cruelty of the Turks: when I thought to find such
favour as one Christian oweth to another, I found them now
more cruel than the Turks, not knowing any cause Why."</p>

<p>"The cause," said he, "is because the King hath wars
with the Queen of England."</p>

<p>For at that instant [<i>April 1587</i>], there was their Army
[<i>Armado</i>] prepared ready to go for England. Whereupon
they would, divers times, give me reproachful words; saying,
That I should hear shortly of their arrival in England. With
innumerable vain brags, which I omit for brevity.</p>

<p>Then did I demand, "If there were not peace between the
King and the Queen's Majesty; whether they would keep
me still?"</p>

<p>"Yea," said he, "unless thou wilt submit thyself to the
faith of the Romish Church." So he commanded me away.</p>

<p>I asked, Wherefore he sent for me; and to send me away,
not alleging any matter against me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>He said, I should have no other matter alleged but that
which I had spoken with mine own mouth.</p>

<p>Then I demanded, "Why they would have the Romish
Church to have the supremacy?"</p>

<p>Whereto he would make no answer.</p>

<p>Then I asked, "If they took me to be a Christian?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "in some respect[s]; but you are out of
the faith of the true Church."</p>

<p>Then the Keeper took me to prison again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And after, for the space of three weeks, I was brought
forth to answer three several times every week. At which
times they did sometimes threaten me with death, some
while with punishment; and many times they attempted to
seduce me with fair words and promises of great preferment:
but when they saw nothing would draw me from the Truth,
they called me "shameless Lutheran!" saying many times,
"See, he is of the very blood of <span class="smcap">Luther</span>! He hath his
very countenance!" with many other frivolous speeches.</p>

<p>After all this, he commanded to put me in the dungeon
within the Castle [<i>i.e. of Palma</i>], five fathoms [<i>30 feet</i>] under
ground; giving me, once a day, a little bread and water.</p>

<p>There remained I one whole year [<i>April 1587 to April
1588</i>], lying on the bare ground, seeing neither sun nor
moon; no, not hearing man woman nor child speak, but
only the Keeper which brought my small victual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It happened about the year's end, upon the Feast of
<span class="smcap">Phillip</span> and <span class="smcap">Jacob
</span> [<i><span class="smcap">JAMES</span></i>], being the first day of May
[1588], that a pretty boy, being the Keeper's son, came to
give me my ordinary food; which he used sometimes to do.</p>

<p>Now, when he opened the [trap] door, and had let down
the basket; I asked, "Who was there?"</p>

<p>He answered by his name, saying, "Here is <span class="smcap">Matthew</span>!"</p>

<p>I asked him, "Where his father was?"</p>

<p>"He is gone to Mass," said he. So he let down the trap
door, and went his way; leaving the rope with the basket
hanging still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>And forasmuch as I lay without all comfort, reposing
myself only unto GOD's Providence; yet unwilling to lose
any opportunity that lay in me, if GOD were pleased,
whereby I might be delivered. So soon as I heard the boy
was gone: I jumped up and took hold of the rope, and
wound myself up to the [trap] door. Setting my foot
against the wall, with my shoulders did I lift the trap door.</p>

<p>Now when I was aloft, and saw no man; for they were
gone to see some ceremonies of their idolatrous exercises in
the city, I knew [of] no way to escape away; being now in
the midst of the way: wherefore it was impossible to convey
myself [away] so secretly, but I should be espied.</p>

<p>Wherefore, for a present shift, I went secretly into a void
[<i>an empty</i>] room of the Castle [<i>i.e. of Palma</i>] where lay great
store of lime and earth: where I tied an old cloth, which I
had, about my head and face to keep the dust out of my
eyes and ears; and so did I creep into the lime, and covered
myself so well as I could, lying there till towards midnight.</p>

<p>And then hearing no man stirring, I got up, and sought
some way to get forth: but could find none. Then, being
greatly perplexed, I bent myself to the good pleasure of
Almighty GOD; making my humble prayers that he would,
of his mercy, vouchsafe to deliver me out of this miserable
thraldom.</p>

<p>And, searching to and fro, in the end I came where three
great horses stood, tied by the head and feet. Then did I
unloose the halters from their heads, and the ropes from
their legs; and went to the Castle wall. When I had tied
them end to end, I made it [<i>the rope</i>] fast to the body of a
vine which grew upon the wall: and by it did I strike
myself over the wall into the town ditch: where I was
constrained to swim about forty paces, before I could get
forth of the ditch.</p>

<p>Then walked I to and fro in the city [<i>Palma</i>] two hours,
seeing no man: neither could I devise any way forth.</p>

<p>Wherefore I returned back again to the town ditch, to see
if I could find any way to bring me without the town walls:
and following the ditch, at the last I perceived, by the noise
of the water, that there was a Water Gate through the wall;
where I searched and found that the issue of the water was
under the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>Then did I very venturously enter the water, and diving
under water got into the Water Gate: and suddenly the
force of the water did drive me through with such violence,
that it cast me headlong against another wall on the outside;
which with the blow did much amaze me.</p>

<p>Yet, by the help of GOD, I recovered, swimming down
the ditch till I came where was a trough or pipe; which I
took to be laid over the ditch, to convey some fresh water
spring into the city.</p>

<p>There did I climb up a post which bare the same, and got
upon the top of the pipe: where some of the Watch, being
near the wall, perceived me; but could not any way come
near to me.</p>

<p>Then cried they, in their tongue, "Who is there?" three
or four times; but I made no answer, but crept as fast as I
could to get off the pipe to land: where, before I could get
down, they shot some of their muskets after me; but,
thanked be GOD, none of the shot did hit me.</p>

<p>Thus, with great difficulty, I escaped out of the city; and
went about six miles from thence before the day brake.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then I went into a thick wood. For I perceived there
were very many sent forth, with hue and cry, both footmen
and horsemen, to apprehend me. Therefore I lay still the
day and night following.</p>

<p>And after, for seven days' space [<i>3rd-9th May 1588</i>], I
wandered through desert ways, among woods and bushes.
Many times, as I came near the Port ways [<i>i.e. the roads to
the seaport Palma</i>], I heard the pursuers inquiring after me;
demanding of divers, Whether they had seen me pass?
Some were very earnest to take me; others wishing that I
might escape: for very many times I was so near them that
I heard every word they spake.</p>

<p>Thus I imagined, by all possible means, to avoid [<i>escape
from</i>] the hands of these unmerciful tyrants; being in great
extremity with hunger and cold. For since the time I came
out of the prison, which was at the least eight days, I had
none other sustenance but berries, which I gathered from
the bushes; and the roots of palm [trees] and other like
roots, which I digged out of the earth: and no other apparel
but an old linen cloth about my body, and a red cap on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
head; without either hose, shoes, or other furniture. So
that, by reason the way was very hard, I was forced to cut
my cap in two; and [to] lap it about my feet, to defend
them from the sharp stones and gravel.</p>

<p>Thus travelling for the most part by night, I chanced to
come where there was a house standing alone; and near the
house there stood a cart wherein lay certain horse collars.
Where searching among them, I found the collars lined
with sheepskins: which skins I rent from the collars, and
apparelled myself with them in this manner:</p>

<p>I put one piece before me like a breastplate, and another
on my shoulders and back; with the woolly side towards
my body: tying them together over my shoulders and under
my arms with Palmite, which is a weed like to that whereof
our hand baskets are made; which is well known to such as
have travelled [in] those parts. And with another piece I
made me a cap.</p>

<p>And in these seemly ornaments I passed forth, till about
three days after [? <i>12th May 1588</i>], very early in a morning,
most unhappily I crossed an highway, where a countryman,
travelling with a mule laden with rundlets of wine, espied
me, and demanded of me, Whither I was bound?</p>

<p>I said, I was going to Coothea [<i>Alcudia, 31 miles from
Palma</i>], which is a town lying on the shore side.</p>

<p>But he, suspecting me to be the man which was pursued,
bade me stay.</p>

<p>But I went onward.</p>

<p>He ran after me, and threw stones at me: but I (not
being able to overrun him, being very feeble) turned back;
and, with a pole which I carried, began to defend myself,
striking at him three or four times. At the last I thrust
at him, and hit him on the breast, and overthrew him:
whereupon he made a horrible cry.</p>

<p>And immediately there came to the number of fifteen
more: some having swords; some, harquebuses; and others,
crossbows. When I was thus beset, knowing no way to
escape, I yielded myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then they bound me hands and feet, laid me on a
mule, and carried me back again to [<i>Palma</i>] the city of
Majorca; delivering me to the Inquisitor: who, when he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
sent me to prison, commanded a pair of bolts to be put
on my legs, and an iron clasp about my neck, with a
chain of five fathoms [<i>30 feet</i>] long hanging thereat; which
was done accordingly.</p>

<p>And on the morrow [? <i>13th May 1588</i>], I was brought
forth to the accustomed place, and in the same manner:
where the Inquisitor sitting, asked first, Why I had broken
prison, and run away?</p>

<p>I said, "To save my life."</p>

<p>"Yea," said he, "but now thou hast offended the law
more than before; and therefore shall the law be now
executed upon thee."</p>

<p>Then I was carried away again. And immediately there
was called an assembly of citizens, and such as were seen
in the Law, to counsel, and to take advice, What punishment
they might inflict upon me?</p>

<p>Which being deliberated, I was brought forth again;
and carried to the Place of Torment: which was in a
cell or vault underground.</p>

<p>There were present but four persons, that is to say,</p>

<p class="p2">The Inquisitor,</p>

<p class="p2">The Solicitor, or Broker, who is to see the law executed.</p>

<p class="p2">A Dutch woman that dwelt in the city; who was commanded thither to tell them what I spake;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because I spake many times in the Dutch tongue.</p>

<p class="p2">And lastly, the Tormentor.</p>

<p>The rack now standing ready before them; with seven
flaxen ropes lying thereon, new[ly] bought from the market.</p>

<p>Then the Inquisitor charged me, as at all other times
he used to do, That I should speak what I had to say,
and to speak the truth; otherwise I should be even now
tormented to death.</p>

<p>I, seeing myself in the hands of such cruel tyrants as
always thirst after the blood of the innocent; even as <span class="smcap">Cain</span>
(who being wroth with his brother <span class="smcap">Abel</span>, and carrying
a heavy countenance) could be no way eased but with his
brother's blood: so I, past hope of life, turned my back towards
them, and seeing my torments present before me, I fell
down on my knees, and besought the Lord to forgive my
sins, and to strengthen my faith, and to grant me patience
to endure to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they took me into a void room, and stripped me
out of my ornaments of sheepskins which I repeated [<i>spoke
of</i>] before; and put a pair of strong canvas breeches upon me.</p>

<p>Then bringing me to the rack again, he commanded
me to lie down. The bars of the rack under me were as
sharp as the back of a knife.</p>

<p>Now I, willingly yielding myself, lay down. Then the
Tormentor bound my hands over my breast crosswise;
and my legs clasped up together, were fast tied the one
foot to the other knee. Then he fastened to either arm
a cord, about the brawn of the arm; and likewise to either
thigh another; which were all made fast again under the
rack to the bars: and with another cord he bound down
my head; and [he] put a hollow cane into my mouth.
Then he put four cudgels into the ropes which were fastened
to my arms and thighs.</p>

<p>Now the woman which was present, being interpreter,
began to persuade me to yield, and confess the faith of
the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>I answered, "If it were the will of GOD that I should
end my life under their cruel hands, I must be content:
but, if it please him, he is able to deliver me, if there were
ten thousands against me."</p>

<p>Then the Tormentor, as he was commanded, began to
wrest the ropes; which he did by little and little, to augment
my pains, and to have them endure the longer: but, in
the end, he drew them with such violence as though he
would have plucked my four quarters in sunder; and there
stayed a good space.</p>

<p>Yet to declare their tyrannical malice, thinking my
torment not sufficient, he added more: pouring water
through a cane which was in my mouth, by little and little,
which I was constrained either to let down, or to have
my breath stopped until they had tunned in such [a]
quantity as was not tolerable to endure; which pained
me extremely.</p>

<p>Yet not satisfied, they took and wet a linen cloth, and
laid it over my mouth till I was almost strangled; when
my body, being thus overcharged with such abundance
of water, after they had thus stopped my breath with the
wet cloth, suddenly with the force of my breath and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
my stomach was so much overcharged, the water gushed
out, and bare away the cloth as if had been the force of
a conduit spout.</p>

<p>When the Inquisitor saw that all this would not make
me yield, he commanded the Tormentor for to wind the
cord on my left arm more strait[ly]; which put me
to horrible pains. And immediately the rope burst in
sunder.</p>

<p>Then said the Inquisitor, "Yea, is he so strong? I will
make him yield!": and commanded the Tormentor to
put a new rope.</p>

<p>Then the woman again bade me yield; saying, It were
better to yield than to die so miserable a death.</p>

<p>But I, beseeching Almighty GOD to ease me of my pains,
and to forgive my sins, answered her, That though they
had power over my body: yet there was no torment should
compel me to yield to their idolatry, whereby I might
bring my soul in danger of hell fire.</p>

<p>Then the Inquisitor asked her, What I said?</p>

<p>She answered, That I had said I would never submit
myself to the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Then did he most vehemently charge me to yield and
submit myself to the Romish Church: otherwise he would
pluck off one of my arms.</p>

<p>Whereupon I denying still, the Tormentor, in most
cruel manner, wrested the ropes as if he would have rent
my body in sunder. I (being now in intollerable pains;
and looking for nothing but present [<i>instant</i>] death) cried
out, in the extremity of my anguish, "Now, farewell wife
and children! and farewell England!": and so, not able to
utter one word more, lay even senseless.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor asked the woman again, What I said?</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon my head, and perceiving that
I was speechless, told him, I was dead.</p>

<p>Wherefore the Tormentor loosed the ropes, unbound
my hands and feet, and carried me into a chamber which
they termed St. Walter's Chamber. Where I came to
myself, and received some sense and reason; but could have
no feeling of any limb or joint. Thus I lay in a most
lamentable and pitiful manner for five days [? <i>14th-18th May
1588</i>], having a continual issue of blood and water forth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
my mouth all that space, and being so feeble and weak, by
reason of my torments, that I could take no sustenance.</p>

<p>Till the sixth day [? <i>19th May 1588</i>] a little recovering
my strength, they gave me a little quantity of bread and
wine sod[den] together: and presently, the very same day,
they carried me forth into the city, and set me upon an ass's
back, and whipped me throughout every street of [<i>Palma</i>]
the city of Majorca; giving me to the number of five
hundred lashes, which made the blood to run down my
miserable carcase in such abundance that it dropped at the
belly of the ass to the ground. Now there were carried with
me about the city very many harlots and whores and other
malefactors which had offended the law; but none punished
like me.</p>

<p>After this, they carried me to the chamber [<i>St. Walter's
Chamber</i>] from whence I came: where I lay without all
worldly comfort.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Can any man, which understandeth the absurd blindness
and wilful ignorance of these Spanish tyrants or Romish
monsters, think them to be of the true Church? which
defend their faith with fire, sword, and hellish torments,
without remorse or pity; as you may perceive by a manifest
trial here set down to the open view of the World. For
when these hell-hounds had tormented this miserable
creature, as you have heard, with a monstrous and most
unchristian kind of torment: which he endured for the space
of three hours, till [he] was at the very point of death and
ready to yield up the ghost: they (not yet satisfied with
these torments, which he had suffered already) reserved his
life, minding to increase his pains; which they were nothing
slack to perform so long as he remained in their power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now the second night after they had whipped me about
the city as aforesaid [? <i>the night of the 20th May 1588</i>],
about midnight, I recounting to myself in what misery I
both did and had remained; I thought to put in practice
once again to get my liberty, craving of the Lord, with
hearty prayer, to assist me with his mighty hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>And immediately searching about, I found an old iron
stub; with the which I brake a hole through the chamber
wall: and crept through into another chamber; where I
felt in the dark many pieces of plate, which I little regarded.
After, I found many towels and table napkins.</p>

<p>Then, seeking further, I found a long cane whereon there
hung many puddings and sausages. I plucked down the
cane, but had little mind on the victual. Then I found
certain knives.</p>

<p>Then I espied some light at a great window in a garret
or loft over me. Wherefore I tied a crooked knife to the
cane, and thrust up a long towel: and with the knife at
the end of the cane, I drew the towel about a bar of
the window, and drew it to me: and with that towel I did
climb up into the window. But then I could not get forth
between the bars, wherefore I digged forth one of the bars;
and tied my towels and napkins together end to end, and
fastened one end to a bar of the window: and then did
slide down by them till I came within three or four fathoms
[<i>18 or 24 feet</i>] of the ground: when the towels brake in
sunder, and I fell down into a well which was direct[ly]
under me, where I was almost drowned. Yet it pleased
GOD to deliver me.</p>

<p>And being then in the city, without the Castle walls;
I, knowing no other way to get out, went again to the
town ditch: where I got through the Water Gate with less
peril than before, by reason there was less water than [there]
was the other time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then went I, with all speed into the woods; lying all
days in [the] woods as close as I could, and travelled by
nights through woods and mountains.</p>

<p>And upon the third night [<i>i.e. after his escape, say the
night of the 23rd May 1588</i>], about midnight, I happened
into an olive garden, not above half a bow shot from the
sea-side; in which garden I found a little skiff or boat
lying under a pomgranate tree: and there lay in the boat a
hatchet. All which served happily for my delivery.</p>

<p>Now I, being unable to carry the boat to the water-side,
did cut small truncheons of wood; and upon them did
slide it down to the water-side. Then I cut an arm [<i>a</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
<i>branch</i>] of an olive tree, to make my boat a mast; and,
having no other shift, made a sail-cloth with my breeches
and a piece of [a] mantle which I had about me. And
for [<i>because</i>] my oars were very mean, yet durst I stay to
look for no better, but presently set sail; and, yielding
myself to the good pleasure of Almighty GOD, betook
myself to the sea: willing rather to abide what the Lord
would lay on me, than to die among these most cruel tyrants.</p>

<p>And by the providence of GOD, upon the second day
[? <i>25th May 1588</i>], in the forenoon, I descried the Coast
of Barbary: for the wind stood north-east [<i>or rather</i> north-west],
which served me most happily.</p>

<p>Understand that this cut is, from shore to shore [<i>that is,
from some point in Majorca to the east side of the Bay of
Bougiah</i>] 150 [<i>or rather</i> 70] leagues, which is 450 [<i>or, at most,
say</i> 210] English miles; and at that time [there was] a
very rough sea; insomuch if it had not been by the great
and wonderful power of GOD, my vessel and I had both
been overwhelmed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I fell in with the country of Cabyles [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>the Little
Kabylia, in the present Province of Constantine</i>], commonly
called the King of Cookooe's land, near a town called Gigeley
[<i>the present Djidjelli</i>]: where I went on shore, leaving my
boat to swim which way the wind and weather would conduct
it; thinking it had done me sufficient service.</p>

<p>But see now, when I had escaped through the surges of
the sea from the cruelty of the Spaniard, I was no sooner
landed and entered the mountains but I was espied by the
Moors which inhabit the country; who pursued very
earnestly to take me; supposing me to be come from the
Christian shore to rob in their coast.</p>

<p>For, many times, the Spaniards will pass over in some
small vessel, and go on shore; and if they can catch
any men of the country, they will carry them away
to make galley slaves: wherefore the Moors are very
diligent to pursue them at their landing; and if it
chance they take any Christian, they use him in like sort.</p>

<p>Wherefore I, being very unwilling to fall into their hands,
was constrained to go into a river, which ran between two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
mountains; and there to stand in water up to the chin,
where the bushes and trees did grow most thick over me: where
I stood certain hours, until they had left searching for me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now when I perceived they were departed, I went out
of the water, being very feeble; for I ate nothing all that
time but the bark of the trees, which I cut with my hatchet.
I went forth as secretly as I could, minding to pass to
Argire [<i>Algiers</i>].</p>

<p>I had not gone above three miles, when I espied a Moor,
a very well favoured old man, who was weeding a field of
wheat.</p>

<p>I spake to him in the tongue of Franke [<i>The</i> Lingua
Franca <i>of the Mediterranean shore</i>], and called him to me.
I, having my hatchet in my hand, cast it from me.</p>

<p>He came unto me; and, taking me by the hand,
demanded very gently, What I would have?</p>

<p>I, perceiving that he did, even at the first sight, pity
my poor and miserable estate, told him all things that
had happened unto me: how I was an Englishman; how
I had been captive in Argire; how I chanced to come to
Genoa; their sending me to Majorca; and all the torment
which I had suffered there; and finally my escape from
thence, with all the rest that followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The charitable
mind of a
simple old
man.</div>

<p>This good aged father, when he had heard of my lamentable
discourse, shewing himself rather a Christian
than a man brought up among the Turkish
Mahometists, greatly pitied my misery; and
forthwith led me home to his house, and caused such
victuals as the country yieldeth to be set before me, which
was dried wheat and honey: and baked a cake upon the
fire hearth, and fried it with butter; which I thought very
good meat, for I had not been at the like banquet in six
years before [1582-1588]; the good father shewing me what
comfort he could.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The old man
still pitied him
and did what
lay in him to
deliver him.</div>

<p>There I remained four and twenty hours. In the meantime
the Moors which dwelt in the villages by,
understanding of my being there, came; and,
calling me forth, inquired of me, What I was?
From whence I came? and Whither I would?:
and, with great vehemency, charged their weapons against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
my breast; insomuch that I thought they would verily have
slain me. But mine host, that good old man, came
forth and answered for me; and so dissuaded them
from doing me any harm: and took me back again into
his house.</p>

<p>This being past, I requested him to help me to a guide
to conduct me to Argire: and he presently provided two,
whereof the one was his son; to whom I promised to give
four crowns for their pains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So taking my leave of my good host, we took our way
towards Argire.</p>

<p>When we had not passed above 24 miles on the way, we
chanced to meet a Gentleman of that country who was, as
it were, Purveyor to the King; and went about the country
to take up corn and grain for the King's provision.
He, meeting us upon the way, asked Whither we were
travelling?</p>

<p>My guides answered, That we were going to Argire.</p>

<p>He asked, What had we to do there?</p>

<p>They said to deliver me there.</p>

<p>Then he demanded, What I was?</p>

<p>They told him, I was an Englishman that came from the
Christian shore, and was bound towards Argire.</p>

<p>Then did this Gentleman take me from them, sending
them back from whence they came; but compelled me to
go with him to village by, and very earnestly persuaded me
to turn Moor: promising, if I would, he would be a mean[s]
to prefer me greatly; which I still denied.</p>

<p>Then, upon the next day, he carried me further, to a
town called Tamgote [? <i>Tamgout</i>], and delivered me to a
Nobleman of great authority with the King: which was
Lieutenant-General for the wars. For this King of Cookooe
holdeth continual war with the King of Argire; although
they be both subject to the Great Turk.</p>

<p>I was no sooner brought before this Nobleman, but he
demanded, Whether I would turn Moor?</p>

<p>I answered, That I would not.</p>

<p>Wherefore immediately he commanded a pair of shackles
to be put on my heels; and a clasp of iron about my neck,
with a chain thereat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>Then was I set on a mule, and conveyed to Cookooe, [<i>also
spelt, in maps later than this narrative</i>, Couco <i>or</i> Cocou. <i>It
was not far from the left bank of the river Sahel, that falls into
the Bay of Bougiah,? the present</i> Akbou], where the King lay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I was come thither, I was presently brought before
the King: who inquired, What I was? and, From whence I
came? and What my pretence was?</p>

<p>I answered, That I was an Englishman; and that I came
from the Christian shore, intending to pass to Argire.</p>

<p>Then he asked me, What I could do?</p>

<p>I told him I could do nothing.</p>

<p>Then he demanded, Whether I were a Gunner?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gunners are in
great estimation
with
them.</div>

<p>I said, "No."</p>

<p>Then he persuaded me very instantly to yield to
their religion, offering to prefer me.</p>

<p>Wherefore I desired him to give me liberty to depart: "for
my desire is to be in England, with my wife and children."</p>

<p>"Yea," said he, "but how wilt thou come there?"</p>

<p>For they minded to keep me still: and evermore the King
assayed to seduce me with promises of great preferment,
saying, If I would serve him and turn Moor: I should want
nothing.</p>

<p>But on the contrary, I besought him to give me liberty to
go to Argire; where I was in hope to be delivered, and sent
home to mine own country.</p>

<p>Now he, seeing he could win me by no gentle means,
commanded me to prison; saying, That he would either
make me yield and turn Moor: or else I should die in
captivity.</p>

<p>In this while that I remained in prison; divers of the
King's House came to me, persuading me to yield to the
King's demand: alleging how hardly the King might use
me, being now in his power, unable to escape; and again
how bountifully the King would deal with me, if I would
submit myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within a little time after, it happened there was great
preparation to receive the King of Abbesse [? <i>the present
tribe of the Beni-Abbas, or Beni-Abb&egrave;s</i>], whose country
adjoineth to the King of Cookooe's land: and [they] are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
league together, and join their armies in one against the
King of Argire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These men are
nothing expert
in Artillery.</div>

<p>Now, at his coming, I was fetched forth of prison,
and commanded to charge certain pieces of ordinance,
which were three Sacres and two Minions
of Brass [<i>See Vol. IV., pp. 250-251</i>]; which I
refused not to do, trusting thereby to get some liberty.
Wherefore, at the coming of the King of Abbesse into the
town, I discharged the ordnance as liked them very well:
for they are not very expert in that exercise. For which I
had some more liberty than before.</p>

<p>This King of Abbesse tarrying some certain time there, in
consulting with the King of Cookooe for matters touching
the Wars with Argire; and understanding of me, sent for
me, being very desirous to talk with me: where, after certain
questions he desired of the other King, that he might buy
me; which he would not grant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Very many
offers of preferment
to draw
me from the
Word of GOD.</div>

<p>Then the King of the Cabyles [<i>Kabyles</i>] or Cookooe persuaded
me very seriously to serve him wil[ling]ly,
and to turn Moor: and offered to give me 700
Doubles [? <i>the Double Pistoles, or Doubloons</i>] by
the year, which amounteth to the sum of &pound;50
[<i>= &pound;200 now</i>] of English money; and moreover to give me
by the day, 30 Aspers, which are worth twelve pence
English, to find me meat; and likewise to give me a house,
and land sufficient to sow a hundred bushels of grain yearly,
and two Plow of oxen furnished, to till the same; also to
furnish me with horse, musket, sword, and other necessaries,
such as they of that country use. And lastly he offered to
give me a wife, which they esteemed the greatest matter;
for all buy their wives at a great price. Yea, if there were
any in his Court could content me, I should make my
choice: but if there were not; he would provide one to my
contentment, whatsoever it should cost him.</p>

<p>But when he perceived all he said was in vain, he sent the
Queen and her gentlewomen to talk with me. When she
came, she very courteously entreated me to turn and serve
the King, and to consider well what a large offer the king
had made; saying, That I was much unlike to come to any
like preferment in my country. And many times she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
shew me her gentlewomen, and ask me, If none of them
could please me?</p>

<p>But I told her, I had a wife in mine own country, to whom
I had vowed my faith before GOD and the World: "which
vow," I said, "I would never break while we both lived."</p>

<p>Then she said, She could but marvel what she should be
whom I esteemed so much as to refuse such offers of preferment,
for her sake; being now where I must remain in
captivity and slavery all the days of my life. But when she
could prevail no way with me; when she had uttered these
foresaid speeches, and many others which were frivolous to
rehearse, she left me. Yet, by her means, I had more
liberty than before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this, I was set to saw boards and planks; and was
commanded to make a carriage for a piece of ordnance.
Thus they compelled me to labour daily: which I did the
more willingly, because I hoped still to get my liberty
thereby in the end.</p>

<p>Then they willed me to shew the fashion of our edge tools,
after the English [manner]: which when they saw the
fashion; their smiths wrought them very artificially, and
gave them very good temper. For these things I was had
in more estimation; insomuch that they took off my irons,
and let me walk abroad with a Keeper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I was made
Master of
work, wherein
I had small
skill.</div>

<p>Then was I commanded by the King to teach the
Carpenters to frame a house after the manner of
English building: and for that purpose there were
sent forth Carpenters and workmen with me to
the woods, to fall timber; all which were to do
what I appointed, upon the King's commandment. Now I,
being Chief Master of the work, appointed out the trees
which were very special good timber. In small time, we
had finished our frame; which liked the King very well.
By this means I had more liberty than before; and was very
well intreated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet I was greatly grieved in mind that I could not procure
any means for my liberty; although at that time, I wanted
few necessaries. Yet was I daily devising how I might
escape away, for three special causes:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One was for the special care I had of my salvation:
because, as you have heard, there were many temptations
laid before me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to draw me from a Christian to be
an abominable idolater.</p>

<p>The second cause was for the love and dutiful allegiance
which I owe to my Prince [<i>Sovereign</i>] and
natural country.</p>

<p>The third was the regard of the vow which I vowed
in matrimony; and the care of my poore wife and
children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which causes moved me so much that whereas, by reason
of my diligence in these foresaid matters, I [was] walking
abroad with my Keeper who, not suspecting me, was not so
attentive as before he had been: so soon as our frame was
finished, I took opportunity; and, shewing them a clean
pair of heels, took my way over the mountains intending to
go for Argire [<i>which was in a north-westerly direction</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But presently there was a great store of men, both on
horseback and on foot: who, being more perfect in the way
than I was, quickly overtook me; and carried me back
again to Cookooe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was presently brought before the King; who asked me
Why I ran away?</p>

<p>I told him, To have liberty.</p>

<p>Then he called certain of his servants to him; and
commanded them to lay me down at his feet, which four of
them did: and laying me flat upon the belly, one of them
gave me 75 stripes with a great cudgel, till I was not able to
remove out of the place.</p>

<p>Then the King commanded to carry me to prison again:
whither two of them carried me and put me in irons, and
there left me. Where I remained for the space of two
months.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">I was now
made a Water-bearer.</div>

<p>Then was I brought forth of prison, and sent daily to a
fountain or well, about half a league from the
town, to fetch water with a couple of asses, for the
use of the King's House.</p>

<p>Now, in this time, many artificers (as Smiths, Joiners, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Carpenters, and many others) came to me to understand the
fashion of many English tools (as plane irons, gouges,
chisels and such like); for which they shewed me some
favour, and gave me some money.</p>

<p>And when I had gotten a little money, I bestowed it upon
apparel, and caused it to be made like to theirs: which I
carried secretly, when I went to fetch water, and did hide it
in a dry cave under the side of a rock. I bought me likewise
a sword and a lance, such as they use to travel with. I also
provided a file. All which I laid up with my apparel.</p>

<p>It happened that the King of Abbesse came again to
visit the King, and to take counsel about warlike affairs; as
usually they did.</p>

<p>Wherefore when they heard of his coming, making great
preparation for him; it fell out so that there wanted water
in the Offices [<i>Kitchens &amp;c.</i>], where, in an evening, there was
exceeding thunder and rain and lightning; so that there
was no man would go for water, but everyone [was] calling
for the Englishman.</p>

<p>Then I, which durst say no "Nay!", took the vessels and
hung them upon the asses; and so went, through rain and
wind and thunder and all, till I came to the well: where I
left my asses to wander whither they would, and went to
my apparel and with my file cut off my irons, and made me
ready in my suit of Moors' clothing, and, with my sword
by my side and my lance on my shoulder, took my way
once again towards Argire.</p>

<p>And that night I went about 20 miles over rocks and
mountains, keeping myself out of beaten ways, casting
[<i>directing</i>] my way by the moon and stars. When the day
began to be light, I lay me down in a brake of thick bushes;
and there I slept the most part of the day: and in the
evening I began to travel forth on my way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, on the third night, I was to pass a bridge where
was continual watch and ward, both day and night; where
I must of necessity pass, by reason the river [? <i>the river Isser</i>]
ran betwixt two mountains: which were so steep that no
man can neither go down to enter [the] water, nor yet being
in can by any possible means get up on the other side;
which river is a great defence to the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>Where I used no delay, but entered the bridge in the
beginning of the night, about nine of the clock, being in
great doubt [<i>fear</i>] of the Watch. But at the first end of
the bridge, I saw no man, until I was happily passed over.
Then there came one after me, and asked, Who goes
there?</p>

<p>It being somewhat dark, and I in apparel and with my
weapons like a Moor; [I] answered boldly, That I was a
friend, and told him, I was coming to the Governor to
deliver letters from the King. For near the river's side
there is a village where dwelleth he who hath charge of the
keeping of this passage. Whereby I went onward through
the village.</p>

<p>But before I was far passed, I heard horsemen upon the
bridge; which asked, Whether any man had passed that
night?</p>

<p>The watermen told them, There was one gone, even now,
which said, He went to deliver the King's letters to the
Officer.</p>

<p>But I thought [it] no time now to hear any more of their
talk; but betook me to my heels: and so soon as I was
without the town, I went out of the Port way [<i>the road to
Algiers</i>] into [the] woods; and kept desert ways that night
and day following.</p>

<p>And the next night, I came within the liberties of the
King of Argire; where I knew the Cabyles [<i>Kabyles</i>] could
not fetch me back again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Many dangerous
wild beasts
in that
country.</div>

<p>In this order I escaped their hands, by the mighty power
of GOD. For understand, in these desert mountains
there are all manner of wild beasts, in great
number; as lions, bears, wolves of marvellous bigness,
apes, wild swine; and also wild horses and asses, with
many other hurtful beasts: yet was I never in danger of any
of them.</p>

<p>In this country of Cabyles, there are divers kinds of very
pure metals, as gold, silver, and lead; and good iron and
steel: but they, for want of knowledge and skill, make no
use of any metal except iron and steel. Although at such
times I have been present, while the Smiths have tried their
iron, I have seen, among the dross of the iron, very perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
gold. Which they, perceiving me to behold, were very inquisitive
to understand, Whether it were gold, or any other
metal of substance?</p>

<p>But I told them, It was but a kind of dross whereof we
made colours for painting in England.</p>

<p>They carried me out to the mountains, and shewed me
the rocks where they gathered their iron; which rocks had
veins of very pure gold. Which I would not reveal to them,
but answered as before: because I doubted [<i>feared</i>] if the
King once knew me to have experience in such mysteries,
he would keep me the more straight[ly]; whereby I might
have remained in bondage during my life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now when I was within the country of Argire, I was out of
dangers from the pursuers; and then did I walk by day and
kept the common ways.</p>

<p>Where, coming within the view of Argire, upon the way I
met a Turk who knew me at the first sight; and demanded,
If I had not been captive with such a man?</p>

<p>I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>He then inquired, Whether I went to the city?</p>

<p>I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Then turned he back, and did accompany me to the city.</p>

<p>When I came there, I would have gone to the English
House; but he led me violently to my old Master [p. <a href="#Page_372">372</a>],
where I rested me a day and night: my Master not being
very earnest, for because, in this time that I was absent
[1587-1588], all the English captives were redeemed and
sent home.</p>

<p>Wherefore I went to the English Consul, hoping to be
presently [<i>instantly</i>] delivered: who gave me very good
words, but did not shew me that favour which he professed.</p>

<p>I could make some discourse of his unkind dealing with
me and others of our countrymen; which I will leave till [a]
more fit occasion.</p>

<p>For, understand, that while I was with him, there came a
messenger from my old Master, with whom I was before I
went to Genoa [<i>in the previous year, 1587</i>]; who would have
carried me away by force: but I would not go, requesting
the Consul to take order for my delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>But he persuaded me to go with him, saying, that he
would, in time, provide for my liberty.</p>

<p>But by means I would not yield to go to my Master, nor
yet the Consul would not take order for me: I was taken by
the King's Officers, and put in chains in the King's prison,
among other captives.</p>

<p>And at the next setting out of the gallies, I was put to my
old occupation; where I remained a galley slave for three
years and above after [1588-1592.] In which time, I was
eight voyages at sea: and at such times as the gallies lay in
harbour, I was imprisoned with the rest of the captives, where
our ordinary food was bread and water; and, at some times,
as once or twice in a week, a small quantity of sodden
wheat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To conclude, I passed my time in sickness and extreme
slavery until, by the help of an honest Merchant [? <i>Master
<span class="smcap">Richard Stapar</span>, see page <a href="#Page_369">369</a></i>;
<i>or rather <span class="smcap">Stapers</span>, see Vol.
III., page 169</i>] of this city of London, and having a very fit
opportunity by means of certain [of] our English ships
which were ready to set sail, bound homeward, upon Christmas
Even, being the 24th of December 1592, I came aboard [<i>at
Algiers</i>] the <i>Cherubim</i> of London; which, weighing anchor,
and having a happy gale, arrived in England towards the
end of February [1593] following.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus have you heard how it hath pleased the Almighty
GOD, after many and great miseries, to bring me to the
port which I longed greatly to see: beseeching GOD, of
his mercy, to prolong the days of our most gracious and
renowned Queen; whose fame reacheth far, and whose most
happy government is in admiration with foreign Princes.</p>

<p>In the First of the <i>Piscatory Eclogues</i>, which <span class="smcap">Phineas Fletcher</span>
included in the Volume containing his <i>Purple Island</i>, printed at Cambridge
in 1633 in 4to; he clearly describes, in the person of <span class="smcap">Thelgon</span>,
the career of his father, <span class="smcap">Giles Fletcher</span> the Elder, LL.D.: who went
English Ambassador to Muscovy; and, on his return home, published,
in 1591, a book entitled <i>Of the Russ Common Wealth</i>; which was
quickly suppressed, lest it might give offence to the Czar.</p>

<p>The Ninth Stanza of this First <i>Piscatory Eclogue</i> thus begins:</p>

<span class="i0">So far credulity and youth had brought me,</span>
<span class="i0">I sang....</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thelgon</span> then specifies the subjects of his Latin and English Poems:
amongst which, in the next Stanza, occurs this line:</p>

<p class="center">
<a id="And_raised_my"></a>
And raised my rhyme to sing of <i><span class="smcap">Richard</span>'s climbing</i>.
</p>

<p>Upon this allusion the authorship of <span class="smcap"><i>Licia</i></span> is ascribed to <span class="smcap">Phineas
Fletcher</span>'s father.</p>

<p>The original edition of these Poems is undated. It was printed
(? privately printed) however about September 1593; as will be seen
from the date on pages 419, 423.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em;"><span class="smcap">HOwsoever</span>, in the settled opinions of some
wise heads, this trifling labour may easily incur
the suspicion of two evils; either to be of an
idle subject, and so frivolous; or vainly handled,
and so odious: yet my resolute purpose was to proceed
so far as the indifferent [<i>impartial</i>] Reader might
think this small pains to be rather an effect, than a cause, of
idleness. And howsoever <span class="smcap">Love</span>, in this Age, hath behaved
himself in that loose manner as it is counted a disgrace to
give him but a kind look: yet I take the passion in itself to
be of that honour and credit as it is the perfect resemblance
of the greatest happiness; and rightly valued at his just
price, in a mind that is sincerely and truly amorous, an affection
of the greatest virtue, and able of himself to eternize the
meanest vassal.</span>
</p>

<p>Concerning the handling of it, especially in this Age, men
may wonder, if a Scholar, How I come by so much leisure?
If otherwise, Why a Writer? Indeed to say truth, though I
cannot justly challenge the first name; yet I wish none to
be Writers, save only such as know Learning. And whereas
my thoughts and some reasons drew me rather to have dealt
in causes of greater weight; yet the present jar of this disagreeing
Age drives me into a fit so melancholy as I only
had leisure to grow passionate. And I see not why, upon
our dissensions, I may not sit down idle, forsake my study,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and go sing of Love; as well as our Brownists forsake the
Church, and write of malice.</p>

<p>And that this is a matter not so unfit for a man, either
that respecteth himself, or is a Scholar; peruse but the
writings of former times: and you shall see, not only others
in other countries, as Italy and France, Men of Learning and
great parts to have written Poems and Sonnets of Love;
but even amongst us, men of best nobility and chiefest
families to be the greatest Scholars and most renowned in
this kind. But two reasons hath made it a thing foolishly
odious in this Age. The one, that so many base companions
are the greatest Writers. The other, that our English Genevian
Purity hath quite debarred us of honest recreation: yet
the great Pillar, as they make him [<i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap">Jean Calvin</span>], of
that Cause hath shewed us as much wit and learning in this
kind as any other before or since.</p>

<p>Furthermore for all students, I will say thus much; that
the base conceit which men generally have of their wants is
such, as I scarce term him a Scholar that hath not all the
accomplyments [<i>accomplishments</i>] of a Gentleman; nor sufficiently
wise that will not take opportunity in some sort to
shew it. For I can say thus much, that the University
wherein I lived [<i>evidently Cambridge</i>], and so I think the
other [<i>Oxford</i>], hath so many wise, excellent, sufficient,
men as, setting their learning aside wherein they are most
excellent, yet in all habiliments of a Gentleman they are
equal to any besides. This would that worthy <span class="smcap">Sydney</span> oft
confess; and [Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Harington</span>'s <i><span class="smcap">Ariosto</span></i> (which,
Madam, was respected so much by you) sheweth that his
abode was in King's College [Cambridge]. Yet now it is
grown to this pass, that Learning is lightly respected; upon
a persuasion that it is to be found everywhere: a thing
untrue and unpossible.</p>

<p>Now in that I have written Love Sonnets; if any man
measure my affection by my style, let him say, I am in love.
No great matter! For if our purest Divines have not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
so, why are so many married? I mislike not that, nor I
would not have them mislike this. For a man may be in
love, and not marry; and yet wise: but he cannot marry
and not be in love, but be a mere fool.</p>

<p>Now for the manner. We will dispute that in some other
place; yet take this by the way: though I am so liberal to
grant thus much&mdash;a man may write of Love and not be in
love; as well as of husbandry and not go to the plough; or
of witches and be none; or of holiness and be flat profane.</p>

<p>But, wise and kind Lady, not to trouble your ears with
this idle discourse, let this suffice. I found favours undeserved
in such manner as my rude ability wants means to
recompence; and therefore in the mean time I request you
to accept this. If I had not so wondered at your admirable
and rare virtues that my heart was surcharged with the
exceeding measure of your worthiness, I had not written.
You are happy every way, and so reputed. Live so, and I
wish so you may live long! Excuse me, favour me: and, if I
live (for I loath to admire without thankfulness), ere long it
shall be known what favours I received from wise Sir
<span class="smcap">Richard</span>; to whom in all kind affects I rest bound.</p>

<p>For the Reader, if he look for my letters to crave his
favour; he is far deceived. For if he mislike anything, I am
sorry he took the pains to read: but if he do, let him dispraise;
I much care not. For praise is not but as men
please, and it is no chief felicity. For I have heard some
men, and of late, for Sermons at Paul's Cross and for other
pains, so commended by all, excepting some few Cynics that
commend none that do well, that you would have thought
England would have striven for their speedy preferment:
but, like a wonder, it last but nine days; and all is quiet and
forgotten. The best is, they are young men and may live to
be preferred at another time. So what am I worse if men
mislike and use terms? I can say as much by them. For
our great men, I am sure, they want leisure to read: and if
they had; yet, for the most part, the worst speak worst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p>Well let the Printer look he grow not a beggar by such
bargains, the Reader that he lose not his labour, and for
mine that is past! And whoso wisely, after an afternoon's
sleep, gapes, and saith, "O how young men spend their time
idly!"; first, let him spend his time better than to sleep:
secondly, he knows not my age. I feared a hot ague; and,
with <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, I was content to let my Wit blood.</p>

<p>But leaving these to their dogged humour; and wishing
your Ladyship all happiness, I humbly take my leave.</p>

<p>From my chamber. September 4, 1593.</p>

<h3 class="chapter"><i>To the Reader.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_small_i.png" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I had</span> thought, courteous and gentle Reader, not
to have troubled thy patience with these lines:
but that, in the neglect thereof, I should either
scorn thee, as careless of thine opinion, a thing
savouring of a proud humour; or despair to obtain thy
favour, which I am loath to conceive of thy good nature.</p>

<p>If I were known, I would entreat in the best manner; and
speak for him whom thou knewest. But being not known,
thou speakest not against me; and therefore I much care
not. For this kind of poetry wherein I wrote, I did it only
to try my humour. And for the matter of Love, it may be
I am so devoted to some one into whose hands these may
light by chance, that she may say, which thou now sayest
"That surely he is in love:" which if she do, then have I
the full recompence of my labour; and the Poems have
dealt sufficiently for the discharge of their own duty.</p>

<p>This Age is learnedly wise, and faultless in this kind of
making their wits known: thinking so basely of our bare
English, wherein thousands have travailed with such ill luck,
that they deem themselves barbarous and the island barren,
unless they have borrowed from Italy, Spain, and France
their best and choicest conceits. For my own part, I am of
this mind that our nation is so exquisite (neither would I
overweeningly seem to flatter our home-spun stuff, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
diminish the credit of our brave travellers) that neither
Italy, Spain, nor France can go beyond us for exact invention.
For if anything be odious amongst us, it is the
exile of our old manners, and some base-born phrases
stuft up with such new terms, as a man may sooner feel
us to flatter by our incrouching eloquence than suspect it
from the ear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And for the matter of Love, where every man takes upon
himself to court exactly; I could justly grace (if it be a
grace to be excellent in that kind) the Inns of Court, and
some Gentlemen like[wise] Students in both Universities:
whose learning and bringing up together with their fine
natures make so sweet a harmony as, without partiality, the
most injurious will prefer them before all others; and therefore
they only are fitted to write of Love.</p>

<p>For others, for the most part, are men of mean reach,
whose debased minds prey upon every bad dish. Men unfit
to know what Love means; deluded fondly with their own
conceit, misdeeming so divine a fancy; taking it to be the
contentment of themselves, the shame of others, the wrong of
virtue; and the refiner of the tongue, boasting of some few
favours. These and such like errors (errors hateful to an
upright mind) commonly by learnless heads are reputed for
Love's Kingdom. But vain men, naturally led; deluded
themselves, [they] deceive others.</p>

<p>For Love is a goddess (pardon me though I speak like a
Poet) not respecting the contentment of him that loves but
the virtues of the beloved, satisfied with wondering, fed with
admiration, respecting nothing but his Lady's worthiness,
made as happy by love as by all favours, chaste by honour,
far from violence: respecting but one; and that one in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
kindness honesty truth constancy and honour, as were all
the World offered to make a change, yet the boot were too
small, and therefore bootless. This is Love, and far more
than this; which I know a vulgar head, a base mind, an
ordinary conceit, a common person will not, and cannot,
have. Thus do I commend that love wherewith, in these
Poems, I have honoured the worthy <span class="gesperrt">LICIA</span>.</p>

<p>But the love wherewith <span class="smcap">Venus'</span> son hath injuriously made
spoil of thousands, is a cruel Tyrant: occasion of sighs,
oracle of lies, enemy of pity, way of error, shape of inconstancy,
temple of treason, faith without assurance, monarch
of tears, murderer of ease, prison of hearts, monster of
Nature, poisoned honey, impudent courtezan, furious bastard:
and in one word, not Love.</p>

<p>Thus, Reader, take heed thou err not! Esteem Love as
thou ought[est]!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If thou muse, What my <span class="smcap">Licia</span> is? Take her to be some
<span class="smcap">Diana</span>, at the least chaste; or some <span class="smcap">Minerva</span>: no <span class="smcap">Venus</span>,
fairer far. It may be she is Learning's Image, or some
heavenly wonder: which the Precisest may not mislike.
Perhaps under that name I have shadowed "[The Holy]
Discipline." It may be, I mean that kind courtesy which
I found at the Patroness of these Poems, it may be some
College. It may be my conceit, and pretend nothing.
Whatsoever it be; if thou like it, take it! and thank the
worthy Lady <span class="smcap">Mollineux</span>, for whose sake thou hast it:
worthy indeed, and so not only reputed by me in private
affection of thankfulness; but so equally to be esteemed by
all that know her.</p>

<p>For if I had not received of her and good Sir <span class="smcap">Richard</span>,
of kind and wise Master <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, of courteous Master <span class="smcap">Houghton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>,</span>
all matchless, matched in one kindred, those unrequitable
favours; I had not thus idly toyed.</p>

<p>If thou mislike it; yet she, or they, or both, or divine
<span class="smcap">Licia</span> shall patronize it: or if none; I will, and can, do it
myself. Yet I wish thy favour. Do but say, Thou art content;
and I rest thine. If not, Farewell! till we both meet.
September 8. 1593.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">LOve</span>, I repent me that I thought
<span class="i6">My sighs and languish dearly bought:</span>
<span class="i6">For sighs and languish both did prove</span>
<span class="i6">That he that languished sighed for love.</span>
<span class="i6">Cruel rigour, foe to State,</span>
<span class="i4">Looks disdainful, fraught with hate,</span>
<span class="i4">I did blame: but had no cause</span>
<span class="i4">(Love hath eyes, but hath no laws).</span>
<span class="i5">She was sad, and could not choose</span>
<span class="i4">To see me sigh, and sit and muse.</span>
<span class="i4">We both did love, and both did doubt [<i>fear</i>]</span>
<span class="i4">Lest any should our love find out.</span>
<span class="i4">Our hearts did speak by sighs most hidden;</span>
<span class="i4">This means was left: all else forbidden.</span>
<span class="i5">I did frown, her love to try</span>
<span class="i4">She did sigh, and straight did cry.</span>
<span class="i4">Both of us did signs believe</span>
<span class="i4">Yet either griev&egrave;d friend to grieve.</span>
<span class="i4">I did look, and then did smile:</span>
<span class="i4">She left sighing all that while.</span>
<span class="i4">Both were glad to see that change;</span>
<span class="i4">Things in love that are not strange.</span>
<span class="i5">Suspicion, foolish foe to Reason,</span>
<span class="i4">Caused me seek to find some treason</span>
<span class="i4">I did court another Dame.</span>
<span class="i4">(False in love, it is a shame!)</span>
<span class="i4">She was sorry this to view,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Thinking faith was proved untrue.</span>
<span class="i5">Then she swore, She would not love</span>
<span class="i4">One, whom false She once did prove.</span>
<span class="i5">I did vow I never meant</span>
<span class="i4">From promise made, for to relent.</span>
<span class="i5">The more I said, the worse she thought:</span>
<span class="i4">My oaths and vows were deemed as nought.</span>
<span class="i4">"False!" She said, "how can it be,</span>
<span class="i4">To court another; yet love me?</span>
<span class="i4">Crowns and Love no partners brook:</span>
<span class="i4">If she be liked, I am forsook!</span>
<span class="i4">Farewell, False! and love her still!</span>
<span class="i4">Your chance was good, but mine was ill.</span>
<span class="i4">No harm to you: but this I crave,</span>
<span class="i4">That your new Love may you deceive!</span>
<span class="i4">And jest with you, as you have done,</span>
<span class="i4">For light's the love that's quickly won."</span>
<span class="i5">"Kind and fair Sweet, once believe me!</span>
<span class="i4">Jest I did; but not to grieve thee.</span>
<span class="i4">Court I did, but did not love.</span>
<span class="i4">Words, and sighs, and what I spent</span>
<span class="i4">In show to her; to you were meant.</span>
<span class="i4">Fond [<i>foolish</i>] I was, your love to cross</span>
<span class="i4">(Jesting love oft brings this loss).</span>
<span class="i4">Forget this fault! and love your friend,</span>
<span class="i4">Which vows his truth unto the end!"</span>
<span class="i5">"Content," She said, "if this you keep."</span>
<span class="i5">Thus both did kiss, and both did weep.</span>
<span class="i4">For women long they cannot chide:</span>
<span class="i4">As I, by proof, in this have tried.</span>

hand, that I never failed of any one enterprise:
but they were all effected to my
own desire and the good of that Government.
Thus passed I forty-two of my
years; [? 1560-1602], GOD assisting with his blessing and
mighty protection.</span></p>

<p>After that all things were quieted and the Border in safety,
towards the end of five years [1598-1603] that I had been
Warden there; having little to do, I resolved upon a journey
to Court, to see my friends and renew my acquaintance there.
I took my journey about the end of the year [<i>which, according
to the old reckoning, ended on the 24th March: say then,
March 1603</i>].</p>

<p>When I came to Court [<i>at Richmond</i>], I found the Queen
ill disposed, and she kept her inner lodging.</p>

<p>Yet she, hearing of my arrival, sent for me.</p>

<p>I found her in one of her withdrawing chambers, sitting
low upon her cushions. She called me to her.</p>

<p>I kissed her hand, and told her, It was my chiefest happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
to see her in safety and health, which I wished might
long continue.</p>

<p>She took me by the hand, and wrung it hard; and said
"No, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>, I am not well!" and then discoursed with me
of her indisposition, and that her heart had been sad and
heavy for ten or twelve days: and, in her discourse, she
fetched not so few as forty or fifty great sighs.</p>

<p>I was grieved, at the first, to see her in this plight: for,
in all my lifetime before, I never knew her fetch a sigh, but
when the Queen of Scots was beheaded. Then [in 1587],
upon my knowledge, she shed many tears and sighs; manifesting
her innocence that she never gave consent to the
death of that Queen.</p>

<p>I used the best words I could to persuade her from this
melancholy humour; but I found, by her, it was too deep
rooted in her heart; and hardly to be removed.</p>

<p>This was upon a Saturday night [? <i>19th March 1603</i>]: and
she gave command that the Great Closet should be prepared
for her to go to Chapel the next morning.</p>

<p>The next day, all things being in a readiness; we long
expected her coming.</p>

<p>After eleven o'clock, one of the Grooms [of the Chambers]
came out, and bade make ready for the Private Closet; for
she would not go to the Great.</p>

<p>There we stayed long for her coming: but at last she had
cushions laid for her in the Privy Chamber, hard by the
Closet door; and there she heard service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From that day forwards, she grew worse and worse. She
remained upon her cushions four days and nights, [? <i>Saturday
19th to Tuesday 22nd March 1603</i>] at the least. All about
her could not persuade her, either to take any sustenance,
or [to] go to bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I, hearing that neither her Physicians, nor none about her,
could persuade her to take any course for her safety, feared
her death would soon after ensue. I could not but think in
what a wretched estate I should be left: most of my livelihood
depending on her life. And hereupon I bethought
myself with what grace and favour I was ever received by
the King of Scots, whensoever I was sent to him. I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
assure myself it was neither unjust, nor unhonest, for me to
do for myself; if GOD, at that time, should call her to his
mercy. Hereupon I wrote to the King of Scots, knowing
him to be the right heir to the Crown of England; and
certified him in what state Her Majesty was. I desired him
not to stir from Edinburgh: and if, of that sickness she should
die, I would be the first man that should bring him news of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Queen grew worse and worse, because she would be
so: none about her being able to persuade her to go to bed.
[The Earl of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>] my Lord Admiral was sent for:
who (by reason of my sister [<span class="smcap">Catharine</span>]'s death, that was his
wife) had absented himself some fortnight from [the] Court.</p>

<p>What by fair means, what by force, he gat her to bed.
There was no hope of her recovery, because she refused all
remedies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Wednesday, the 23rd of March [1603], she grew speechless.
That afternoon, by signs, she called for her [Privy]
Council: and by putting her hand to her head, when the
King of Scots was named to succeed her, they all knew he
was the man she desired should reign after her.</p>

<p>About six at night, she made signs for [<span class="smcap">John Whitgift</span>]
the Archbishop, and her Chaplains to come to her. At
which time, I went in with them; and sat upon my knees
full of tears to see that heavy sight.</p>

<p>Her Majesty lay upon her back; with one hand in the
bed, and the other without.</p>

<p>The [Arch]bishop kneeled down by her, and examined
her first of her faith: and she so punctually answered all
his several questions by lifting up her eyes, and holding up
her hand, as it was a comfort to all beholders.</p>

<p>Then the good man told her plainly, What she was; and
What she was to come to: and though she had been long a
great Queen here upon earth; yet shortly she was to yield
an account of her stewardship to the King of Kings.</p>

<p>After this, he began to pray: and all that were by did
answer him. After he had continued long in prayer, till the
old man's knees were weary, he blessed her, and meant to
rise and leave her.</p>

<p>The Queen made a sign with her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>My sister [<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, Lady] <span class="smcap">Scroope</span>, knowing her
meaning, told the Bishop, The Queen desired he would pray
still.</p>

<p>He did so for a long half-hour after; and then thought to
have left her.</p>

<p>The second time she made sign to have him continue in
prayer.</p>

<p>He did so for half an hour more, with earnest cries to GOD
for her soul's health; which he uttered with that fervency of
spirit as the Queen, to all our sight, much rejoiced thereat:
and gave testimony to us all, of her Christian and comfortable
end.</p>

<p>By this time, it grew late; and every one departed: all
but her Women that attended her.</p>

<p>This that I heard with my ears, and did see with my eyes,
I thought it my duty to set down, and to affirm it for a
truth upon the faith of a Christian; because I know there
have been many false lies reported of the end and death of
that good Lady.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I went to my lodging, and left word with one in the
Cofferer's Chamber to call me, if that night it was thought
she would die; and gave the Porter an angel [<i>10s. = &pound;2 now</i>]
to let me in at any time, when I called.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Between one and two of the clock on Thursday morning
[25th March 1603], he that I left in the Cofferer's Chamber,
brought me word, "The Queen was dead."</p>

<p>I rose, and made all haste to the Gate [of Richmond Palace],
to get in.</p>

<p>There I was answered, I could not enter: the Lords of
the [Privy] Council having been with him [<i>the Porter</i>] and
commanded him that none should go in or out, but by Warrant
from them.</p>

<p>At the very instant, one of the Council [Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Wotton</span>, <i>afterwards</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Wotton</span>; see page <a href="#Page_526">526</a>] the Comptroller
[of the Household] asked, Whether I was at the Gate?</p>

<p>I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>He said, If I pleased, he would let me in.</p>

<p>I desired to know how the Queen was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>He answered, "Pretty well."</p>

<p>I bade him "Good Night!"</p>

<p>He replied and said, "Sir, if you will come in; I will give
you my word and credit you shall go out again at your own
pleasure."</p>

<p>Upon his word, I entered the Gate, and came up to the
Cofferer's Chamber: where I found all the Ladies weeping
bitterly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He [the <i>Comptroller</i>] led me from thence to the Privy
Chamber; where all the [Privy] Council was assembled.</p>

<p>There I was caught hold of; and assured I should not go
for Scotland till their pleasures were further known.</p>

<p>I told them, "I came of purpose, to that end."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From thence, they all went to [Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Cecil</span>] the
Secretary's Chamber: and, as they went, they gave a special
command to the Porters, that none should go out at the
Gates but such servants as they should send to prepare their
coaches and horses for London.</p>

<p>Thus was I left, in the midst of the Court, to think my
own thoughts till they had done counsel. I went to
[<span class="smcap">George</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Hunsdon</span>] my brother's chamber: who was
in bed, having been over-watched many nights before.</p>

<p>I got him up with all speed; and when the [Privy]
Council's men were going out of the Gate, my brother thrust
to the Gate.</p>

<p>The Porter, knowing him to be a Great Officer, let him
out. I pressed after him, and was stayed by the Porter.</p>

<p>My brother said angrily to the Porter, "Let him out, I
will answer for him!" Whereupon I was suffered to pass:
which I was not a little glad of.</p>

<p>I got to horse, and rode to the Knight Marshal's Lodging
by Charing Cross; and there stayed till the Lords [of the
Privy Council] came to Whitehall Garden.</p>

<p>I stayed there till it was nine a clock in the morning;
and hearing that all the Lords were in the Old Orchard at
Whitehall, I sent the [Knight] Marshal to tell them, That I
had stayed all that while, to know their pleasures; and that I
would attend them, if they would command me any service.</p>

<p>They were very glad when they heard I was not gone:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
and desired the [Knight] Marshal to send for me; and I
should, with all speed, be despatched for Scotland.</p>

<p>The [Knight] Marshal believed them; and sent Sir
<span class="smcap">Arthur Savage</span> for me.</p>

<p>I made haste to them.</p>

<p>One of the [Privy] Council, [Sir <span class="smcap">William Knollys</span>] my
Lord of [<span class="smcap">Banbury</span>] that now is [see page <a href="#Page_526">526</a>], whispered
the [Knight] Marshal in the ear, and told him, If I came;
they would stay me, and send some other in my stead.</p>

<p>The [Knight] Marshal got from them; and met me
coming to them, between the two Gates. He bade me, Be
gone! for he had learned, for certain, that if I came to them,
they would betray me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I returned, and took horse between nine and ten a clock;
and [by] that night rode to Doncaster [<i>162 miles from London;
and 235 miles from Edinburgh</i>].</p>

<p>The Friday night [the 26th], I came to my own house at
Widdrington [<i>298 miles from London; and 99 miles from
Edinburgh</i>]; and presently took order with my Deputies [of
the Middle Marches, <span class="smcap">Henry Widdrington</span> and <span class="smcap">William
Fenwick</span>; see page <a href="#Page_499">499</a>] to see the Borders kept in quiet;
which they had much to do: and gave order [that], the next
morning, the King of Scotland should be proclaimed King
of England [at Widdrington]; and at Morpeth [<i>289 miles
from London</i>] and Alnwick [<i>306 miles from London</i>].</p>

<p>Very early, on Saturday [27th March 1603], I took horse
[at Widdrington] for Edinburgh; and came to Norham
[<i>331 miles from London, 8 miles South of Berwick, and 66
miles from Edinburgh</i>], about twelve at noon. So that I
might well have been with the King at supper time: but I
got a great fall by the way [<i>i.e. after leaving Norham</i>]; and
my horse, with one of his heels, gave me a great blow on the
head, that made me shed much blood. It made me so weak,
that I was forced to ride a soft pace after: so that the King
was newly gone to bed by the time I knocked at the gate
[of Holyrood House, Edinburgh].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was quickly let in; and carried up to the King's Chamber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
I kneeled by him, and saluted him by his title of "England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland."</p>

<p>He gave me his hand to kiss; and bade me welcome.</p>

<p>After he had long discoursed of the manner of the Queen's
sickness, and of her death; he asked, What letters I had
from the [Privy] Council?</p>

<p>I told him, "None": and acquainted him how narrowly I
[had] escaped from them. And yet I brought him a blue
ring from a Lady,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
that I hoped would give him assurance
of the truth that I had reported.</p>

<p>He took it, and looked upon it, and said, "It is enough.
I know by this, you are a true messenger."</p>

<p>Then he committed me to the charge of my Lord
<span class="smcap">Home</span>; and gave straight command that I should want
nothing.</p>

<p>He sent for his Chirurgions to attend me; and when I
kissed his hand, at my departure, he said to me these gracious
words:</p>

<p>"I know you have lost a near kinswoman and a loving
Mistress: but take here my hand, I will be as good a Master
to you; and will requite you this service with honour and
reward."</p>

<p>So I left him that night, and went with my Lord HOME
to my lodging: where I had all things fitting for so weary
a man as I was. After my head was dressed, I took leave
of my Lord and many others that attended me; and went
to my rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning [Sunday, 28th March 1603], by ten
a clock, my Lord <span class="smcap">Home</span> was sent to me from the King, to
know how I had rested: and withal said, That His Majesty
commanded him to know of me, What it was that I desired
most that he should do for me? [and] bade me, Ask, and it
should be granted.</p>

<p>I desired my Lord to say to His Majesty from me, That
I had no reason to importune him for any suit; for that I
had not, as yet, done him any service: but my humble
request to His Majesty was to admit me a Gentleman of
his Bedchamber; and hereafter, I knew, if His Majesty saw
me worthy, I should not want to taste of his bounty.</p>

<p>My Lord returned this answer, That he [<i>the King</i>] sent me
word back, "with all his heart, I should have my request."</p>

<p>And the next time I came to Court, which was some four
days after [Thursday, 1st April 1603], at night, I was called
into his Bedchamber: and there, by my Lord [the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Lenox</span>, <i>afterwards</i> Duke] of <span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, in his presence, I
was sworn one of the Gentlemen of his Bedchamber; and
presently I helped to take off his clothes, and stayed till he
was in bed.</p>

<p>After this, there came, daily, Gentlemen and Noblemen
from our Court; and the King set down a fixed day [Tuesday,
5th April 1603] for his departure towards London.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the report of the Queen's death, the East Border
broke forth into great unruliness; insomuch as many complaints
came to the King thereof. I was desirous to go to
appease them; but I was so weak and ill of my head, that
I was not able to undertake such a journey [<i>expedition</i>]: but
I offered that I would send my two Deputies, that should
appease the trouble and make them quiet; which was by
them, shortly after, effected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now was I to begin a new World: for by the King's
coming to the crown, I was to lose the best part of my
living. For [with the death of the Queen] my Office of
Wardenry ceased; and I lost the pay of 40 Horse: which
were not so little, both [of them] as £1,000 per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the Great Ones in Court envied my happiness,
when they heard I was sworn of the King's Bedchamber:
and in Scotland I had no acquaintance. I only relied on
GOD and the King. The one never left me: the other,
shortly after his coming to London, deceived my expectation;
and adhered to those that sought my ruin.</p>

public, no time can be too late to express so excellent
a matter. Wherein the dutiful love of many noble
subjects so manifestly appeared to our dread Lord

exchange for that which was indeed but duty; though
so adorned with munificent bounty, that most

<p>Thursday, the 24th of March, some two hours after midnight
[<i>i.e. 25th March 1603</i>], departed the spirit of that
great Princess from the prison of her weak body; which
now sleeps in the Sepulchre of her grandfather [<i>i.e. in
<span class="smcap">Henry</span> VII.'s Chapel in Westminster Abbey</i>].</p>

<p>The Council of State and the Nobility (on whom the
care of all the country chiefly depended), immediately
assembling together, no doubt assisted with the Spirit
of Truth, considering the infallible right of our Sovereign
Lord, King <span class="smcap">James</span>, took such order that the news of the
Queen's death should no sooner be spread to deject the
hearts of the people; but, at the instant, they should be
comforted with the Proclaiming of the King.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being hereon determined, Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Carey</span> took his
journey in post towards Scotland, to signify to the King's
Majesty the sad tidings of his Royal Sister's death; and
the joyful hearts of his subjects that expected no comfort
but in, and by, His Majesty's blessed Government.</p>

<p>This noble Gentleman's care was such that he intermitted
no time: but, notwithstanding his sundry shift[s] of horses
and some falls that bruised him very sore, he by the way,
proclaimed the King at Morpeth.</p>

three days.</p>

<p>But before we come there, you shall understand what
was instantly done at Berwick by Sir <span class="smcap">John Carey</span>, upon
the news brought by Sir <span class="smcap">Robert</span> his brother. Who, like
a worthy soldier and politic Statesman, considering it was
a town of great import and a place of war [<i>Berwick was
the Portsmouth of England at this time, and bridled Scotland</i>];
he caused all the garrison to be summoned together, as
also the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses: in whose presence
he made a short and pithy Oration, including Her Majesty's
death, and signifying the intent of the State for submitting
to their lawful Lord.</p>

<p>And presently, with great contentment of all parties, His
Majesty was proclaimed King of England, Scotland,
France, etc. on Saturday, in the afternoon, being the
26th of March [1603], about three of the clock. Where
all the people, though they grieved for their late Queen;
yet was grief suddenly turned to pleasure, in expectation
of their new King. But we will post from Berwick after
Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Carey</span>, and overtake him in Edinburgh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You understood before, that Sir <span class="smcap">Robert</span> came to Edinburgh
on Saturday night; where, being admitted to the
King, be-blooded with great falls and bruises, [he] brought
His Highness the first news of Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s death:
which howsoever it presented him with kingdoms, glory,
and immense wealth; yet, like his royal self, he showed
apparent signs of princely sorrow. And dismissing Sir
<span class="smcap">Robert Carey</span>, after so great toil, to his repose: His
Majesty continued in his grief; and through that, expressed
his true piety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was thought necessary in so high affairs to let slip
no occasion, however sorrow particularly touched His
Majesty for the loss of his private friend and royal Sister;
yet the general care as well of those his people in Scotland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
as for us in England, caused him on Sunday, being the 27th
of March [1603], to despatch [<span class="smcap">John Bothwell</span>] the Bishop
of <span class="smcap">Holyroodhouse</span> to Berwick: that he might receive
the town to his use, as the nearest place wherein, by right,
he claimed possession.</p>

<p>Who accordingly, making all the speed he might, came
to Berwick; where of the Governor he was honourably
entertained: and, after signifying His Majesty's pleasure,
reposed himself for that night.</p>

<p>On Monday, being the 28th of March, by sound of
trumpet, the Governor, Mayor, Officers, and Council of the
town were assembled at the Cross; where there the Governor
[Sir <span class="smcap">John Carey</span>] surrendered to the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Holyroodhouse</span>
his staff and all his authority, unto the King's
Majesty's use. So likewise did the Mayor deliver up the
keys of the town.</p>

<p>And the said Bishop, being thus seised of all authority
to His Majesty's use, ministered the Oath of Allegiance
unto the Governor, Mayor, and the Superior Officers
belonging to the garrison and to the town.</p>

<p>Which oath taken, the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Holyroodhouse</span>
(expressing the gracious intention of His Majesty, as well
to them as all others his subjects of England whom he found
like them affected: which was rather to maintain, than to
infringe, their Charters; to give, than to take from them
anything) redelivered the keys and staff of authority to the
Mayor and Governor. So likewise to every Commander,
Captain, Lieutenant, and whatsoever Office they had before
Her Majesty's death, there, in the King's name, he confirmed
them: to their great joy and contentment. Thus spent
the Lord of <span class="smcap">Holyroodhouse</span> the first part of Monday in
Berwick; and dined with the Magistrates.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the Lord Governor and his chief Officers
of place called together all the soldiers that were under pay;
so did the Mayor and Aldermen convene all the communalty
of the town. To whom when the oath was read, and the
Magistrates had certified them that they had been their
example; the Lord of <span class="smcap">Holyroodhouse</span> wondered at, and
much commended, their joy and readiness to be sworn
servants to so regal a Master. Which he amply discoursed
at his return to Edinburgh the next day; not hiding any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
of their forward applauses, but delivered their willingness
to His Highness with express and lively words: assuring
him, by his entrance into England at that little door, how
welcome into the wide house His Excellence should be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While this was a doing in Berwick, there drew to the
King hourly most of the Nobility in Scotland, with sundry
Knights and Gentlemen; gratulating the great blessings
befallen His Highness, and attending his royal pleasure.</p>

<p>Besides, many numbers of Gentlemen came out of England
to salute His Majesty; all [of] whom he graciously welcomed,
and honoured one of them with the Order of Knighthood,
<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;being
Master <span class="smcap">John Peyton</span> [co. Norf.], son to Sir <span class="smcap">John
Peyton</span>, Lieutenant of the Tower of London. This being to
that noble Gentleman no little glory that he was first Knight&mdash;yea,
named by the King's Majesty "his first Knight"&mdash;that
was made by our Sovereign after he was nominated
and truly known to be the mightiest King in Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the continuance of His Majesty in Scotland, before
his Progress towards England, his whole care was for the
peaceable government of that Realm, from which he was a
while to part. And to that end, he had sundry conferences
with his Nobility, laying the safest projects that, in his wisdom
and their experiences, seemed likely for effecting his royal
desire: which, GOD willing, will come to pass to his great
liking and [the] benefit of both the Realms.</p>

<p>But that it might more to his people appear; he in person
came graciously to the city of Edinburgh, unto the Public
Sermon. And after the Sermon was finished, in a most
learned but more loving Oration, he expressed his occasion
of leaving them, to the burgesses and a number of the people:
exhorting them to continue in obedience, being the bond
that binds Princes to affect their subjects, which broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
on their part he trusted should never be, and of his they were
assured; persuading them also to agreement amongst themselves,
being the bond of charity that tied all men, especially
Christians, to love and bear with one another. In which
obedience to him, and agreement amongst themselves if
they continued: howsoever he was, in a manner, at that time,
constrained to leave them; yet he would, in his own person,
visit them, and that shortly, in times convenient and most
necessary for his own advancement and their benefit.</p>

<p>Yet for all his kingly oratory, mild behaviour, and true
intention; the people's hearts against his departure were
even dead: and grief seized every private man's reins, saving
only those that were made happy by attending his royal
person into England.</p>

<p>For now they began duly to think upon his unmatched
virtues, which never the most malicious enemy could impeach:
being in the World's eye innocent of any capital and
notorious crime, but such as may be incident to any just
man; who daily falls, but never falls away. They now
considered his affability, mercy, justice, and magnanimity
They remembered how, in late years, Scotland, by his
government, had increased in more riches than in the time
of many [of] his predecessors: besides, his care for establishing
true religion, his traffic almost with all nations, the
royalty of his marriage, the blessings hoped for by his issue.</p>

<p>And such a universal sorrow was amongst them, that
some of the meaner sort spake even distractedly; and
[there were] none but, at his departing (which yet we are
not come unto), expressed such sorrow as in that nation
hath seldom been seen the like: albeit the King's Majesty
was possessed of that which the common sort of the nation
long wished for; I mean, the Kingdom [of England].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 31st of March [1603], being Thursday, His Majesty,
with great solemnity and pomp, was proclaimed King of
England, Scotland, France and Ireland, at the Market
Cross of Edinburgh, in presence of the whole Officers of
Estate of the Realm, and many of the Nobility of Scotland,
and sundry Knights and Gentlemen of England.</p>

<p>And in the evening of that day, there were many
hundreds of bonfires made all about the city; with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
feasting and merriment held till the appearing of the next
day.</p>

<p>But as joyful as they were of His Majesty's great
advancement, and enlarging of his Empire; so were they,
as I before noted, for their private want of him no less
filled with grief as, above all other times, was most
apparently expressed at his departure from Edinburgh
towards England: the cries of [the] poor people being
so lamentable and confused that it moved His Majesty
to much compassion; yet seeing their clamours were only
of affection and not grounded on reason, with many gracious
and loving words he left them, and proceeded on his Progress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the 5th of April, being Tuesday, that His Majesty
departed from Edinburgh, gallantly accompanied with
multitudes of his Nobility, Lords, Barons, and Gentlemen of
Scotland; and some French, as the French Ambassor
being Leger [<i>? resident</i>] in Scotland, whose wife was carried
betwixt Edinburgh and London by eight pioneers or porters;
one four to relieve the other four by turns, carrying her in a
chair with slings.</p>

<p>As also His Majesty, being accompanied with his own
attendants, as the Duke of <span class="smcap">Lenox</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Argyle</span>,
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Murray</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Cassillis</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Mar</span>,
the Lord <span class="smcap">Home</span>, the Lord <span class="smcap">Oliphant</span>, and sundry others
too tedious in this place to be repeated; for that several
their names shall hereafter be more particularly expressed.</p>

<p>Besides, there were in His Highness's train, many
numbers of gallant and well appointed English Knights and
Gentlemen: who attended His Majesty that day from
Edinburgh unto Dunglass, a House of the Lord <span class="smcap">Home</span>'s;
where His Excellence reposed himself that night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wednesday, the 6th of April, His Majesty progressed
from Dunglass towards Berwick: having then attending on
him many more Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen; besides
the Lords Wardens of the Borders of England and Scotland,
attended by the Borderers with several companies to receive
him. The Lord Governor of Berwick also, being accompanied
with all the Council of War, the Constables with
their Cornets of Horse, and divers of the Captains; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
Band of Gentlemen Pensioners [of Berwick] with divers
Gentlemen; advanced forward to entertain and conduct His
Majesty into the town of Berwick.</p>

<p>Happy day, when peaceably so many warlike English Gentlemen
went to bring in an English and Scottish King, both included
in one person, into that town that, many a hundred
years, hath been a town of the enemy; or at the least held,
in all leagues, either for one nation or the other. But the
King of Peace have glory, that so peaceably hath ordained
a King, descended from the royal blood of either nation, to
make that town, by his possessing it, a harbour for English
and Scots, without thought of wrong or grudging envy.</p>

<p>Not to digress longer, these gallants met him and were
graciously respected of His Highness; so falling in among
the other Trophies, they set forward.</p>

<p>And when His Highness came within some half mile of
the town, and began to take view thereof; it suddenly
seemed like an enchanted Castle. For from the mouths of
dreadful engines (not long before full fed, by moderate arts-men
that knew how to stop and empty the brass and iron
paunches, of those roaring noises) came such a tempest as
dreadful, and sometimes more deathful, than thunder; that
all the ground thereabout trembled as in an earthquake, the
houses and towers staggering: wrapping the whole town in
a mantle of smoke, wherein the same was a while hid from
the sight of his royal owner.</p>

<p>But nothing violent can be permanent. It was too hot to
last: and yet I have heard it credibly reported, that a better
Peal of Ordnance was never, in any soldier's memory (and
there are some [of] old King <span class="smcap">Harry</span>'s lads in Berwick, I
can tell you!) discharged in that place. Neither was it very
strange, for no man can remember Berwick honoured with
the approach of so powerful a Master.</p>

<p>Well, the King is now very near the gates: and as all
darkness flies before the face of the sun, so did these clouds
of smoke and gunpowder vanish at his gracious approach.</p>

<p>In the clearness of which fair time, issued out of the town
Master <span class="smcap">William Selby</span> [co. Northumb.] Gentleman,
Porter of Berwick, with divers Gentlemen of good repute;
and [he], humbling himself before the King's Majesty,
presented unto him the keys of all the ports [<i>gates</i>]&mdash;who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
received them graciously: and when His Highness was
entered betwixt the gates, he restored to the said Master
<span class="smcap">Selby</span> the keys again, and graced him with the honour of
Knighthood, for this his especial service; in that he was the
first man that possessed His Excellence of those keys, Berwick
indeed being the gate that opened into all his dominions.</p>

<p>This done, His Highness entered the second gate, and
being within both the walls he was received by the Captain
of the Ward: and so passed through a double Guard of
soldiers, well armed in all points; but, with looks humble
and words cheerful, they gave His Majesty to know their
hearts witnessed that their arms were worn only to be used
in his royal service.</p>

<p>Between this Guard, His Majesty passed on to the Market
Cross, where the Mayor and his Brethren [<i>the Aldermen</i>]
received him with no small signs of joy, and such signs of
triumph as the brevity of time for preparation would admit.
But the common people seemed so overwrapt with his
presence, that they omitted nothing, their power and
capacities could attain unto, to express loyal duty and
hearty affection: kneeling, shouting, crying "Welcome!"
and "GOD save King <span class="smcap">James</span>!" till they were, in a manner,
entreated to be silent.</p>

<p>As soon as it pleased the people to give him leave that
he might speak, Master <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, the Recorder of
Berwick, being a man grave and reverend, made a brief
speech to His Majesty, acknowledging him [as] their sole
and Sovereign Lord. To whom, in the town's name, he
surrendered their Charter: presenting His Highness also
from them with a purse of gold; which, as an offering of
their love, he graciously received. And for their Charter,
he answered them most benignly and royally, That it should
be continued: and that he would maintain their privileges,
and uphold them and their town in all equity; by reason it
was the principal and first place honoured with his mighty
and most gracious person.</p>

<p>These ceremonies amongst the townsmen ended: as his
usual manner is after any journey, His Majesty passed to
the Church, there to humble himself before the Exalter of
the humble: and [to] thank him for the benefits bestowed
upon him and all his people. At which time preached before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
him, the Reverend Father in God, Doctor <span class="smcap">Toby
Matthew</span>, Bishop of <span class="smcap">Durham</span>: who made a most learned
and worthy Sermon.</p>

<p>Which finished, the King departed to his Palace; and then
they gave him a Peel of great Ordnance, more hot than
before: Berwick having never had King to rest within her
walls well nigh these hundred years.</p>

<p>The night was quickly overpassed especially with the
townsmen that, never in a night, thought themselves securer:
but the journey of the hours is always one, however they are
made short or long by the apprehension of joy, or [the]
sufferance of grief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning's sun chased away the clouds of sleep from
every eye; which the more willingly opened that they might
be comforted with the sight of their beloved Sovereign:
who, in his estate, attended upon by the Governor and the
Noblemen, together with the Magistrates and Officers of the
town, passed to the Church, where he stayed the Divine
Prayers and Sermon; which when with his wonted humility
he had heard finished, in the like estate he returned to his
Palace.</p>

<p>This day, being Thursday the 7th of April, His Majesty
ascended the walls; whereupon all the Cannoniers and
other Officers belonging to the great Ordnance stood, everyone
in his place: the Captains with their Bands [<i>Companies</i>]
of soldiers likewise under their several Colours. Amongst
which warlike train, as His Majesty was very pleasant and
gracious; so to shew instance how he loved and respected
the Art Military, he made a shot himself out of a cannon, so
fair, and with such sign of experience, that the most expert
Gunners there beheld it not without admiration: and there
were none, of judgement, present but, without flattery, gave
it just commendation.</p>

<p>Of no little estimation did the Gunners account themselves
after this kingly shot: but His Majesty, above all
virtues in temperance most excellent, left that part of the
wall, and their extraordinary applause.</p>

<p>Being attended by his Nobility both of Scotland and
England (the Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Howard</span>, brother to the late
Duke of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>; and the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, being then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
newly come to the town), and guarded by the Gentlemen
Pensioners of Berwick; he bestowed this day in surveying of
the plots [<i>plans</i>] and fortifications, commending the manner
of the soldiers, and the military order of the town: being
indeed one of the best places of strength in all the north of
England. All which, when, with great liking, he had to his
kingly pleasure beheld; he returned to his Palace, and there
reposed till the next day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 8th of April, being Friday, the trumpets warned for
the remove. And, all that morning, His Majesty, with
royal liberality, bestowed amongst the garrison soldiers,
and every Officer for war according to his place, so rich and
bounteous rewards that all soldiers, by his bountiful
beginning there, may be assured that they shall not, as they
have been, be curtailed of their duties [<i>what is due to them</i>]
by exacting Pollers; but used as the servants and servitors
of a King: which very name, but more his largess, adds
double spirit to a man of war.</p>

<p>After dinner, His Highness mounted on horseback and
took leave of Berwick: where, near the bridge, he knighted
Master <span class="smcap">Ralph Grey</span> [co. Northumb.]; a Gentleman of
great command and possession[s] near the Borders.</p>

<p>As his Excellence left Berwick, and entered the Realm
of England, he was received by Master <span class="smcap">Nicholas Forster</span>
[of Bamburgh Abbey], High Sheriff of Northumberland,
[<i>whom he knighted at Widdrington</i>]: who, besides his own
servants and followers, was accompanied with a number of
gallant Gentlemen of the Shire; who, riding before His
Majesty, led the way towards Widdrington, where His
Majesty intended to rest that night.</p>

<p>By the way, of his kingly goodness, and royal inclinations
to the honour of arms and reverence of virtuous age, he
vouchsafed to visit that worthy honourable soldier, Sir <span class="smcap">William
Read</span>: who, being blind with age, was so comforted
with the presence and gracious speeches of the King, that
his spirits seemed so powerful within him, as he boasted
himself to feel the warmth of youth stir in his frost-nipt
blood. The way His Majesty had to ride, being long,
enforced him to stay with this good Knight the less while:
but that little time was so comfortable that his friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
hope it will be a mean[s] to cherish the old Knight all his
life long.</p>

<p>Not to be longer writing this than His Highness was
riding the journey; he departed thence upon the spur,
scarce any of his train being able to keep him company:
for being near[ly] 37 miles, he rode it all in less than four
hours. And, by the way, for a note, the miles, according
to the Northern phrase, are a wey-bit longer than they be
here in the South.</p>

<p>Well, as long as the miles were, His Majesty made short
work, and attained [to] Widdrington [Castle]: where by
the Master of the Place, Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Carey</span> [Lord Warden
of the Middle Marches. He was afterwards made Earl of
<span class="smcap">Monmouth</span>. <i>See pages</i> 476-484], and his right virtuous Lady,
he was received with all due affection; the House being
plentifully furnished for his entertainment. Besides for
situation and pleasure it stands very delightful.</p>

<p>His Majesty, having a little while reposed himself after
his great journey, found new occasion to travel further.
For, as he was delighting himself with the pleasure of the
Park, he suddenly beheld a number of deer near the place.
The game being so fair before him, he could not forbear;
but, according to his wonted manner, forth he went, and
slew two of them.</p>

<p>Which done, he returned with a good appetite to the
House, where he was most royally feasted and banqueted
that night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Saturday the 9th April [1603], His Majesty prepared
towards Newcastle-[on-Tyne]. But before his departure from
Widdrington; he knighted Master <span class="smcap">Henry Widdrington</span>,
Master <span class="smcap">William Fenwick</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Edward Gorges</span>
[all co. Northum.].</p>

<p>After which, taking his leave with royal courtesy,
he set forwards towards Newcastle; being 16 miles from
Widdrington.</p>

<p>To pass the occurrents by the way, being not very
material; when His Majesty drew near to Newcastle, the
Mayor, the Aldermen, Council, and best Commoners of
the same besides numbers of other people, in joyful manner
met him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mayor presented him with the Sword and Keys
with humble duty and submission: which His Highness
graciously accepting, he returned them again. He gave
also to His Majesty, in token of their love and hearty
loyalty, a purse full of gold. His Majesty gave them full
power and authority under him as they lately held in Her
Majesty's name: ratifying all customs and privileges that
they were possessed of, and had a long time held.</p>

<p>And so, passing on, he was conducted to the Mayor's
house, where he was richly entertained; and remained
there three days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon Sunday, being the 10th April [1603], His Majesty
went to the Church, before whom [Dr <span class="smcap">Toby Matthew</span>]
the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Durham</span> preached. And that day, as it is
his most Christianlike custom, being spent in devotion:
he rested till Monday, which he bestowed in viewing the
town, the manner and beauty of the bridge [over the Tyne]
and key [<i>quay</i>]: being one of the fairest in all the north
parts. Besides, he released all prisoners; except those that
lay for treason, murder, and Papistry: giving great sums of
money for the release of many that were imprisoned for
debt; who heartily praised GOD, and blessed His Majesty,
for their unexpected liberty.</p>

<p>So joyful were the townsmen of Newcastle of His
Majesty there being, that they thankfully bare all the
charge of his Household during the time of his abode with
them, being from Saturday till Wednesday morning. All
things were in such plenty and so delicate for variety
that it gave great contentment to His Majesty; and on
the townsmen's part, there was nothing but willingness
appeared; save only at His Highness's departure, but
[of that] there was no remedy. He hath yet many of his
people by his presence to comfort: and forward no doubt
he will; as he thence did, giving thanks to them for their
loyal and hearty affection.</p>

<p>And on the bridge, before he came at Gateside; he made
Master <span class="smcap">Robert Dudley</span> [? <span class="smcap">Delavale</span>, co. Northumb.],
Mayor of Newcastle, Knight.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">John Philipot</span> states that the following were also
knighted at Newcastle on this 13th of April 1603:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>This Wednesday, being the 13th of April [1603], His
Majesty set forward towards Durham. And at Gateside,
near Newcastle; he was met by the Sheriff of the County
and most of the Gentlemen in the same.</p>

<p>In his way, near Chester a Street, a little town betwixt
Newcastle and Durham, he turned on the left hand of the
road to view [Lumley Castle,] a pleasant castle of the Lord
<span class="smcap">Lumley</span>'s: which being a goodly edifice of free stone, built
in quadrant manner, stands on the shoring of a hill, in the
middle of a green, with a river at the foot of it; and woods
about it on every side but to the townward, which is, by the
river [Wear], divided from it.</p>

<p>After His Highness had a while delighted himself with
the pleasures of the place; he returned on his way towards
Durham, being 6 miles from thence. Of which way he
seldom makes [a] long journey.</p>

<p>And when he came near; the Magistrates of the city
met him; and behaving themselves as others before them,
it was by His Highness as thankfully accepted. And
passing through the gates, whence His Excellence entered
the Market Place, there was an excellent oration made
unto him, containing in effect the universal joy conceived by
his subjects at his approach; being of power to divert
from them so great a sorrow as had lately possessed them
all.</p>

<p>The oration ended, he passed towards the Bishop's House;
where he was royally received: [Dr. <span class="smcap">Toby Matthew</span>] the
Bishop attending His Majesty with a hundred Gentlemen
in tawny liveries.</p>

<p>Of all his entertainment in particular at the Bishop's;
[of] his [<i>the King's</i>] merry and well seasoned jests, as well
there as in other parts of his journey; all his words being of
full weight, and his jests filled with the salt of wit: yet so
facetious and pleasant as they were no less gracious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
worthy of regard than the words of so royal a Majesty&mdash;it
is bootless to repeat them, they are so well known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thursday, being the 14th day [of April 1603], His
Majesty took leave of the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Durham</span>: whom he
greatly graced and commended for his learning, humanity,
and gravity: promising to restore divers things taken
from the Bishopric; which he hath accordingly in part
done, giving him already possession of Durham House in
the Strand.</p>

<p>In brief, His Majesty left Durham, and removed towards
[High] Walworth [<i>also called</i> Walworth Castle]; being 16
miles from Durham: where, by the Gentlewoman of the
House, named Mistress <span class="smcap">Genison</span> [<i>or rather</i> the Widow of
<span class="smcap">Thomas Jenison</span>], he was so bountifully entertained that
it gave His Excellence very high contentment.</p>

<p>And after his quiet repose there that night, and some part
of the next day; he took his leave of the Gentlewoman, with
many thankful and princely congratulations for her extending
costs in the entertainment of him and his train.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Friday, being the 15th of April [1603], His Majesty set
forward from Mistress <span class="smcap">Genison</span>'s of Walworth, towards
York. His train [was] still increasing by the numbers of
Noblemen and Gentlemen from the south parts, that came
to offer him fealty and to rejoice at his sight. Whose love,
although he greatly tendered; yet did their multitudes so
oppress the country and make provision[s] so dear that he
was fain to publish an Inhibition against the inordinate and
daily access of people's coming, that many were stopped of
their way; and only those that had affairs suffered to have
access, some of great name and office being sent home, to
attend their places.</p>

<p>All this notwithstanding; a number there were in His
Highness's train; still increasing in every shire.</p>

<p>For now [Master <span class="smcap">Henry Bellassis</span>] the High Sheriff of
Yorkshire, gallantly accompanied, attended His Majesty to
Master [<span class="smcap">William</span>] <span class="smcap">Ingleby</span>'s [<i>? at Baldersby Park</i>] besides
Topcliffe, being about 16 miles from Walworth; who with
great submission received His Majesty: and there he rested
for that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>On Saturday, being the 16th of April [1603], His Majesty
removed from Master <span class="smcap">Ingleby</span>'s towards York, being 16
miles from Topcliffe.</p>

<p>And when he came about some 3 miles from York, the
Liberties of the City extending so far; Master <span class="smcap">Bucke</span> and
Master <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> Sheriffs of the City met him; and, with
humble duty, presented him with their White Staffs:
which His Majesty receiving, he delivered them instantly
again [to them]. So they attended him towards the City.</p>

<p>Within a mile of which, when His Highness approached,
there met him [<span class="smcap">William Cecil</span>] the Lord <span class="smcap">Burlegh</span>, Lord
President of the North, with many worthy Knights and
Gentlemen of the shire. These also attended on his person
to York.</p>

<p>Where, when he came near unto the City, there met him
three of the Sergeants at Arms, late servants to the deceased
Queen: viz., Master <span class="smcap">Wood</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Damfort</span>, and Master
<span class="smcap">Westrop</span>: who delivered up their maces; which His
Majesty, with royal courtesy, redelivered to them; commanding
them to wait on him in their old places, which
presently they did.</p>

<p>And, at the same time, the Sergeant Trumpeter, with
some others of his fellows, did in like manner submit themselves,
and render their service; which he benignly accepted,
and commanded them in like manner to wait on him.</p>

<p>Then rode he on till he came to one of the gates of York;
where [<span class="smcap">Robert Walter</span>] the Lord Mayor of the City, the
Aldermen, and the wealthiest Commoners, with abundance
of other people, met him.</p>

<p>There a long oration being made, the Lord Mayor
delivered the Sword and Keys to His Majesty, together with
a cup of gold, filled full of gold: which present His Majesty
gratefully accepted; delivering the Keys again to the Lord
Mayor.</p>

<p>But about the bearing of the Sword, there was some contention;
the Lord President [of the North] taking it for his
place, the Lord Mayor of the city esteeming it his.</p>

<p>But to decide the doubt, the King's Majesty merrily
demanded If the Sword being his, they would not be pleased
that he should have the disposing thereof.</p>

<p>Whereunto when they humbly answered, It was all in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
pleasure; His Highness delivered the Sword to one that
knew well how to use a sword, having been tried both at sea
and on shore, [<span class="smcap">George Clifford</span>] the thrice honoured Earl
of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>; who bare it before His Majesty, riding in
great state from the gate to the Minster.</p>

<p>In which way, there was a conduit that, all the day long,
ran white, and claret, wine[s]; every man to drink as much
as he listed.</p>

<p>From the Minster His Majesty went on foot to his own
House, being the Manor of St Mary's; having all the way a
rich canopy over his head, supported by four Knights: and
being brought hither, he was honourable received by the
Lord <span class="smcap">Burlegh</span>; who gave cheerful entertainment to all the
followers of His Majesty during the time of his continuance
in York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 17th day [of April 1603], being Sunday, His Majesty
passed towards York Minster; being one of the goodliest
Minsters in all the land: England being as famous for
churches as any one kingdom in Europe, if they were kept
in reparations as that Minster is.</p>

<p>To this Minster, the King passed to hear the Sermon; and
at the gate [<i>i.e., of the Manor House</i>] a coach was offered to
His Highness. But he graciously answered, "I will have no
coach. For the people are desirous to see a King, and so
they shall: for they shall as well see his body as his face."
So, to the great comfort of the people, he went on foot to
the Church; and there heard the Sermon, which was
preached by [Dr <span class="smcap">John Thornborough</span>, Dean of York and
also] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Limerick</span>: whose doctrine and method
of teaching was highly by His Majesty commended. And
what his judgment is, is as extant to us all of any understanding
as the light of the clear mid-day, or sun, to every
perfect eye.</p>

<p>The Sermon ended, His Majesty returned afoot, in the
same sort as he came, to his Manor; where he was royally
feasted.</p>

<p>This Sunday was a Seminary Priest apprended, who
before, under the title [<i>appearance</i>] of a Gentleman had
delivered a Petition to His Majesty, in the name of all the
English Catholics. When he was taken, His Highness had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
some conference with him: but, by reason of other great
affairs, he referred him to be further examined by the Bishop
of <span class="smcap">Limerick</span>; who, presenting the effects of his Examination,
the Priest was, the next day committed.</p>

<p>Dinner being ended, His Majesty walked into the garden
of the Palace; being a most delightful place: where there
awaited him a number of Gentlemen of great name and
worth; whose commendations he received from honourable
persons, and beheld honour charactered in their faces. For
this is one especial note in His Majesty. Any man that hath
aught with him, let him be sure he have a just cause! for he
beholds all men's faces with steadfastness, and commonly the
look is the window for the heart.</p>

<p>Well, to that I should handle. Amongst these Gentlemen
it pleased His Majesty to make choice of these following;
whom he graced with the honour of Knighthood:</p>

<p>The same day, His Majesty caused five Gentlemen to be
sworn his servants, which served Queen Elizabeth before
time: whose names were Master <span class="smcap">Richard Connigsby</span>,
Master <span class="smcap">George Pollard</span>, Ushers, Daily Waiters; Master
<span class="smcap">Thomas Rolles</span> and Master <span class="smcap">Hariffe</span>, Gentlemen, Quarter
Waiters; and Master <span class="smcap">Richard Read-head</span>, Gentleman
Sewer in Ordinary of His Majesty's Chamber.</p>

<p>This day likewise, the Mayor of Kingston upon Hull
delivered to His Majesty a petition, which was also subscribed
and justified by divers Aldermen of the said town,
to be done in the behalf of all the poor inhabitants: who,
with one voice, besought His Majesty that they might be
relieved and succoured against the daily spoils done to them
by those of Dunkirk, that had long molested them and
others the English coastmen.</p>

<p>His Highness, as he is naturally inclined to much pity, so
at that time he seemed to have great compassion of their
wrongs and afflictions; which were not hidden from him,
though they had been silent: but he comforted them with
his princely and heroic reply, That he would defend them;
and no Dunkirker should after dare to do any of his subjects
wrong.</p>

<p>In which assurance they departed: and, no doubt, shall
find the effect of his kingly promise.</p>

<p>I told you before, what bounty the Lord <span class="smcap">Burlegh</span> used
during the continuance of the King's Majesty in the Manor
[of St Mary's at York]: but it was indeed exceeding all the
rest in any place of England before. Butteries, Pantries,
and Cellars [being] always held open in great abundance, for
all comers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monday, being the 18th day [of April 1603], His Majesty
was feasted by the Lord Mayor of York, whom he knighted
by the name of Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Walter</span> [co. York]: at whose
house there was such plenty of all delicates [<i>delicacies</i>] as
could be possibly devised.</p>

<p>After dinner, His Majesty, following the rule of mercy he
had begun with, commanded all the prisoners to be set at
liberty, except Papists and wilful murderers.</p>

<p>Which deed of charity effected, he left York, and rode to
Grimstone [Hall], being a house of Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Stanhope</span>'s;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
where he lay that night, and dined the next day: His
Majesty and all his train having their most bountiful entertainment;
all the Offices in the house standing open for all
comers, every man without check eating and drinking at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Before His Majesty's departure from Grimstone, he
knighted these Gentlemen:</p>

<p>The 19th day [of April 1603] being Tuesday, His Majesty
took his journey towards Doncaster. Where, by the way,
he went to Pomfret [<i>Pontefract</i>], to see the Castle: which
when he had at pleasure viewed; he took horse and rode to
Doncaster where he lodged all night at the sign of the <i>Bear</i>
in an Inn; giving the host of the house, for his good entertainment,
a lease of a Manor House in a reversion, of good value.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 20th day [of April 1603], being Wednesday, His
Majesty rode towards Worsop [Manor], the noble [<span class="smcap">Gilbert
Talbot</span>] Earl of <span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span>'s House: and at Batine
[<i>? Bawtry</i>] the High Sheriff of Yorkshire took his leave of
the King, and there Master [<span class="smcap">Roger</span>] <span class="smcap">Askoth</span> [<i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Ascough</span>,
<i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Ayscue</span>] the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire received
him; being gallantly appointed both with horse and man.</p>

<p>And so he conducted His Majesty on, till he came within
a mile of Blyth: where His Highness lighted, and sat down
on a bankside to eat and drink.</p>

<p>After His Majesty's short repast, to Worsop His Majesty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
rides forward. But, by the way, in the Park he was
somewhat stayed. For there appeared a number of Huntsmen,
all in green; the chief of which, with a woodman's
speech, did welcome him, offering His Majesty to shew
him some game: which he gladly condescended [<i>agreed</i>] to
see; and, with a train set, he hunted a good space, very
much delighted.</p>

<p>At last he went into the House, where he was so nobly
received, with superfluity of things, that still every entertainment
seemed to exceed others. In this place, besides the
abundance of all provision[s] and delicacie[s], there was most
excellent soul-ravishing music; wherewith His Highness
was not a little delighted.</p>

<p>At Worsop, he rested on Wednesday night, and in the
morning stayed breakfast. Which ended, there was such
store of provision left, of fowl, of fish, and almost everything,
besides bread beer and wine, that it was left open for any
man that would, to come and take.</p>

<p>After breakfast, His Majesty prepared to remove: but
before his departure he made these Gentlemen, Knights;
whose names are following:</p>

<p>The 21st [day of April 1603], being Thursday, His
Highness took his way towards Newark upon Trent; where,
that night, he lodged in the Castle, being his own house:
where the Aldermen of Newark presented His Majesty with
a fair gilt cup, manifesting their duties and loving hearts to
him: which was very kindly accepted.</p>

<p>In this town, and in the Court, was taken a cutpurse,
doing the deed; and, being a base pilfering thief, yet was
all Gentleman-like on the outside. This fellow had [a] good
store of coin found about him: and, upon his examination,
confessed that he had, from Berwick to that place, played
the cutpurse in the Court. His fellow was ill missed, for no
doubt he had a walking mate. They drew together like
coach horses, and it is pity they did not go hang together.
For His Majesty, hearing of this nimming gallant, directed
a Warrant presently to the Recorder of Newark, to have
him hanged: which was accordingly executed.</p>

<p>This bearing small comfort to all the rest of his pilfering
faculty, that the first subject that suffered death in England,
in the reign of King James, was a cutpurse: which fault,
if they amend not, heaven suddenly send the rest [the
same fate]!</p>

<p>The King, ere he went from Newark, as he had
commanded this silken base thief, in justice, to be put to
death; so, in his benign and gracious mercy, he gives life
to all the other poor and wretched prisoners: clearing the
Castle of them all.</p>

<p>This deed of charity done; before he left Newark [on the
22nd April], he made these Knights:</p>

Where His Highness was not only royally and most plentifully
received: but with such exceeding joy of the good Earl
and his honourable Lady, that he took therein exceeding
pleasure.</p>

<p>The 23rd day [of April], being Saturday, after the making
of these Knights, and having refreshed himself at breakfast;
His Majesty took kind leave of the Earl of <span class="smcap">Rutland</span>, his
Countess, and the rest: and set forward towards Burlegh.</p>

<p>And, by the way, he dined at Sir <span class="smcap">John Harington</span>'s
[House? <i>at Harington-Burley</i>]; where that worthy Knight
made him most royal entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner, His Highness removed towards Burlegh,
being near Stamford in Northamptonshire. His Majesty on
the way was attended by many Lords and Knights. And,
before his coming, there were provided train-cents and live
hares in baskets [that] being carried to the Heath [<i>? Empington
Heath</i>], made excellent sport for His Majesty. All the
way between Sir <span class="smcap">John Harington</span>'s and Stamford, Sir
<span class="smcap">John</span>'s best hounds with good mouths followed the game;
the King taking great leisure and pleasure in the same.</p>

<p>Upon this Heath, not far from Stamford, there appeared
to the number of a hundred high men, that seemed like the
Patagones [<i>Patagonians</i>], huge long fellows of twelve or
fourteen feet high, that are reported to live on the Main
[<i>mainland</i>] of Brazil, near to the Straits of Magellan. The
King, at the first sight, wondered what they were; for that
they overlooked horse and man. But, when all came to all,
they proved a company of poor honest suitors, all going
upon high stilts, preferring a Petition against the Lady
<span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. What their request was, I know not: but His
Majesty referred them till his coming to London; and so
passed on from those giants of the Fens towards Stamford.</p>

<p>Within half a mile whereof, the Bailiffs and the rest of the
chief townsmen of Stamford presented a gift unto His
Majesty; which was graciously accepted. So rode he
forward through the town, in great state, having the Sword
borne before him; the people joyful on all parts to see him.</p>

<p>When His Highness came to Stamford Bridge; the
Sheriff of Lincolnshire humbly took his leave, and departed
greatly in the King's grace.</p>

<p>On the other part, the town standing in two Shires,
stood ready [Master <span class="smcap">William Tate</span>] the High Sheriff
of Northamptonshire, bravely accompanied, and gallantly
appointed with men and horse; who received his Majesty,
and attended him to Burlegh: where His Highness with all
his train were received with great magnificence; the House
seeming so rich as if it had been furnished at the charges of
an Emperor. Well, it was all too little, His Majesty being
worthy [of] much more; being now the greatest Christian
monarch, of himself as absolute.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day [24th April 1603], being Easter Day, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
preached before His Highness, [Dr <i>William Chaderton</i>]
the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>; and the Sermon was no sooner
done, but all [the] Offices in the house were set open, that
every man might have free access to Butteries, Pantries;
[and] Kitchens; to eat and drink in at their pleasures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, being Monday the 25th of April [1603],
His Highness rode back again to Sir <span class="smcap">John Harington</span>'s
[House at Harington-Burley]; and by the way his horse fell
with him, and [he] very dangerously bruised his arm; to the
great amazement and grief of all them that were about His
Majesty at that time. But he, being of an invincible
courage, and his blood yet hot, made light of it at the first:
and being mounted again, rode to Sir <span class="smcap">John Harington</span>'s;
where he continued that night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And, on Tuesday morning, the pain received by his fall
was so great that he was not able to ride on horseback; but
he turned from Sir <span class="smcap">John Harington</span>'s, to take a coach:
wherein His Highness returned to Burlegh, where he was
royally entertained as before; but not with half that joy,
the report of His Majesty's hurt had disturbed all the Court
so much.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, being Wednesday the 27th day of April
[1603], His Majesty removed from Burlegh towards Master
<span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>'s.</p>

<p>And, in the way, he dined at that worthy and worshipful
Knight's, Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Mildmay</span>'s [at Apethorpe]; where
nothing wanted in a subject's duty to his Sovereign, nor
anything in so potent a Sovereign to grace so loyal a
subject. Dinner being most sumptuously furnished, the
tables were newly covered with costly Banquets [<i>Dessert</i>]:
wherein everything that was most delicious for taste proved
[the] more delicate by the art that made it seem beauteous
to the eye: the Lady of the House being one of the most
excellent Confectioners in England; though I confess many
honourable women [to be] very expert.</p>

<p>Dinner and Banquet [<i>Dessert</i>] being past, and His
Majesty at point to depart; Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, considering
how His Majesty vouchsafed to honour him with his royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
presence, presented His Highness with a gallant Barbary
horse, and a very rich saddle with furniture suitable thereto:
which His Majesty most lovingly and thankfully accepted:
and so, taking his princely leave, set forward on the way.</p>

<p>In this remove towards Master <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>'s did
the people flock in greater numbers than in any place
northward. Though many before pressed to see their
Sovereign, yet here the numbers multiplied.</p>

<p>This day, as His Majesty passed through a great common
(which, as the people thereabout complain, Sir <span class="smcap">I. Spenser</span>
[<span class="smcap">John Spencer</span>] of London hath very uncharitably molested
[<i>enclosed</i>]), most of the country [<i>district</i>] joined together,
beseeching His Majesty that the common might be laid
open again for the comfort of the poor inhabiters thereabouts:
which His Highness most graciously promised
should be performed, according to their hearts' desire.</p>

<p>And so, with many benedictions of the comforted people,
he passed on till he came within half a mile of Master
<span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>'s [at Hinchinbrook Priory]; where
met him the Bailiff of Huntingdon, who made a long oration
to His Majesty, and there delivered him the Sword, which
His Highness gave to the new[ly] released [<span class="smcap">Henry
Wriothsley</span>] Earl of <span class="smcap">Southampton</span> [<i>the Patron of
<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span></i>] to bear before him.</p>

<p>O admirable work of mercy! confirming the hearts of all
true subjects in the good opinion of His Majesty's royal
compassion: not alone to deliver from the captivity such
high Nobility, but to use vulgarly with great favours not
only him, but also the children of his late honourable
fellow in distress [<i>i.e.</i> of <span class="smcap">Robert Devereux</span> Earl of
<span class="smcap">Essex</span>]. Well, GOD have glory, that can send friends, in
the hour he best pleaseth, to help them that trust in him.</p>

<p>But to the matter. His Majesty passed, in state, the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Southampton</span> bearing the Sword before him, as
I before said he was appointed, to Master <span class="smcap">Oliver
Cromwell</span>'s house: where His Majesty and all his
followers, with all comers whatsoever, had such entertainment,
as the like had not been seen in any place before,
since his first setting forward out of Scotland.</p>

<p>There was such plenty and variety of meats: such
diversity of wines, and those not riffe ruffe but ever the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
best of the kind; and the cellars open at any man's
pleasure. And if it were so common with wine, there is
little question but the Butteries for beer and ale were
more common; yet in neither was there difference. For
whoever entered the house, which to no man was denied,
tasted what they had a mind to: and after a taste, found fullness:
no man, like a man, being denied what he would call for.</p>

<p>As this bounty was held back to none within the house;
so for such poor people as would not press in, there were
many open beer-houses erected: where there was no want
of beef and bread for the comfort of the poorest creatures.
Neither was this provision for the little time of His
Majesty's stay; but it was made ready [for] fourteen days:
and, after His Highness's departure, distributed to as many
as had [a] mind to it.</p>

<p>There attended also at Master <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>'s, the
Heads of the University of Cambridge, all clad in scarlet
gowns and corner-caps: who, having presence of His
Majesty, there was made a most learned and eloquent
Oration in Latin, welcoming His Majesty, as also intreating
the confirmation of their Charter and privileges: which His
Majesty most willingly and free granted. They also presented
His Majesty with divers books published in commendation
of our late gracious Queen: all which was most
graciously accepted of His Highness.</p>

<p>Also Master <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> presented His Majesty with
many rich and acceptable gifts: as a very great and a very
fair wrought Standing Cup of gold, goodly horses, float
[<i>? fleet</i>] and deep-mouthed hounds, divers hawks of excellent
wing. And at the remove, [he] gave &pound;50 [<i>= &pound;200 now</i>]
amongst His Majesty's Officers.</p>

<p>Upon the 29th day [of April 1603], being Friday, after
His Highness had broke his fast; he took kind and
gracious leave of Master <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>
<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and his
virtuous Lady, late widow to that noble and opulent Knight,
Signor <span class="smcap">Horatio Paulo Vicino</span>.</p>

<p>Thence, with many regal thanks for his entertainment, he
departed to Royston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p>

<p>And as he passed through Godmanchester, a town close
by Huntingdon, the Bailiffs of the town with their Brethren
met him; and acknowledged their allegiance. There, convoying
him through their town, they presented him with
threescore and ten team[s] of horse all traced to fair new
ploughs; in shew of their husbandry.</p>

<p>Which, while His Majesty, being very well delighted
with the sight, demanded, Why they offered him so many
horses and ploughs? he was resolved [<i>answered</i>], That it
was their ancient custom whensoever any King of England
passed through their town, so to present His Excellence.
Besides, they added, that they held their lands by that
tenure; being the King's tenants.</p>

<p>His Majesty not only took well in worth their good
minds; but bade them use well their ploughs: being glad
he was landlord of so many good husbandmen in one town.</p>

<p>I trust His Highness, when he knows well the wrong, will
take order for those, as Her Majesty began, that turn
ploughland into pasturage: and where many good husbandmen
dwelt there is now nothing left but a great house
without [a] fire: the Lord commonly at sojourn near
London; and for the husbandmen and ploughs, he only
maintains a shepherd and his dog. But what do I talking
of sheep! when I am to follow the gests of a King. I will
leave them and their wolfish Lords, that have eaten up
poor husbandmen like sheep: and proceed where I left [off].</p>

<p>His Majesty, being past Godmanchester, held on his way
to Royston; and drawing near the town, the Sheriff of
Huntingdonshire humbly took his leave. And there he
was received by that worthy Knight, Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Denny</span>,
High Sheriff of Hertfordshire, attended upon by a goodly
company of proper men, being in number seven score,
suitably apparelled. Their liveries [were] blue coats,
with sleeves parted in the midst, buttoned behind in
jerkin fashion; and white doublets: and hats and
feathers: and all of them mounted on horses with red
saddles.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, after his humble duty done, presented
His Majesty with a gallant horse, a rich saddle, and furniture
correspondent to the same; being of great value:
which His Majesty accepted very graciously, and caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
him to ride on the same before him. This worthy Knight,
being of a deliver spirit and agile body, quickly mounted,
managing the gallant beast with neat and eiduing workmanship
[<i>? eye-doing horsemanship</i>]: being in a rich suit of a
yellow dun colour; somewhat near the colour of the horse,
and the furniture.</p>

<p>And thus, in brave manner, he conducted His Majesty
to one Master <span class="smcap">Chester</span>'s house [at Cockenhatch]: where
His Highness lay that night, at his own kingly charge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 30th day [of April 1603], being Saturday, His
Majesty took his journey towards Standon, to Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Sadler</span>'s: and, by the way, [Dr <span class="smcap">Richard Bancroft</span>] the
Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span> met him; attended on by a seemly
company of Gentlemen in tawny coats and chains of
gold.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Sadler</span>'s, His Majesty was royally
entertained, for himself and his kingly train: nothing
being wanting the best desired, nor the meanest could
demand.</p>

<p>There His Majesty stayed [on] Sunday: before whom the
Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span> preached.</p>

<p>His Majesty, now drawing near to London, the numbers
of people more and more increased, as well of Nobility,
Gentry, Citizens, country people, and all; as well of degree
as of no degree. So great a desire had the Noble that
they pressed with the ignoble to see their Sovereign: this
being the difference of their desires, that the better sort,
either in blood or of conceit, came to observe and serve; the
other to see and wonder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 1st of May [1603], being Monday, His Majesty
removed to Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Cock</span>'s [at Broxburn Bury], being
9 miles from Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Sadler</span>'s: where provision for
His Majesty and his royal train was so abundant that there
was no man of what condition soever, but had what his
appetite desired. For His Majesty's private and most to be
respected entertainment: it was such as ministered His
Highness great contentment.</p>

<p>Continuing there but one night, and departing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
next day; [he] honoured the good Knight for his greater
expenses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 3rd of May [1603], being Tuesday, His Majesty took
his journey towards Theobalds, a house belonging to Sir
<span class="smcap">Robert Cecil</span>, and about 4 miles distant from Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry Cock</span>'s: where met him [Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Egerton</span>,
<i>afterwards</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Ellesmere</span>,] the Lord Keeper [of the
Great Seal], [<span class="smcap">Thomas Sackville</span>, Earl of <span class="smcap">Dorset</span>,] the
Lord Treasurer, [<span class="smcap">Charles Howard</span>, Earl of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>,]
the Lord Admiral, with most of the Nobility of the
land and [the] Council of Estate; who were graciously
received.</p>

<p>At which time, the Lord Keeper made a most grave,
learned, brief, and pithy oration to His Majesty: to which
His Highness answered with great grace and princely
wisdom.</p>

<p>At this house there met His Majesty all, or the most part,
of the old servants and Officers in [the] Household of our
late royal Mistress, Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>; and with them, the
Guard of His Majesty's Body: all of them being courteously
received to their own content.</p>

<p>Also in this house of Theobalds, His Majesty made
divers Noblemen of Scotland, of his Honourable Privy
Council [of England], viz:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:5em;">[<span class="smcap">Lodowick Stuart</span>,]
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Lenox</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:5em;">[<span class="smcap">John Erskine</span>,]
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Mar</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:5em;">[<span class="smcap">Alexander Home</span>,]

him were but to imitate geographers that set a little o for
a mighty Province: words being hardly able to express what
was done there indeed, considering the multitude that
thither resorted, besides the train; none going hence unsatisfied.

<p>At Theobalds, His Majesty made these Knights [on

<p>The 7th of May [1603], being Saturday, His Majesty
removed from Theobalds, towards London, riding through
the meadows: where, within two miles on this side of
Waltham, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Denny</span> discharged his followers.</p>

<p>And there, Master <span class="smcap">Swinnerton</span>, one of the Sheriffs
of London, accompanied with the Sheriff of Middlesex,
met his Majesty, with sixty men in livery cloaks; where
an eloquent and learned oration was made to His Highness.</p>

<p>Besides these men in livery cloaks that attended the
Sheriff, all well mounted on gallant horses; most of the
Sheriff's Officers attended him: who conducted His Majesty
[to] within two miles of London.</p>

<p>And at Stamford Hill [Master <span class="smcap">Robert Lee</span>] the Lord
Mayor of London presented him with the Sword and Keys
of the City: with whom were the Knights and Aldermen
in scarlet gowns and great chains of gold about their necks,
with the Chief Officers and Council of the City. Besides
500 citizens, all very well mounted, clad in velvet coats
and chains of gold; with the chief Gentlemen of the
Hundreds: who made a gallant shew to entertain their
Sovereign.</p>

<p>There also met his Majesty, all his Officers of Estate, as
Serjeants at Arms with their rich maces; the Heralds with
their Coats of Arms, and Trumpeters: every one in their
order and due place.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Lenox</span> bore the Sword of Honour before
His Majesty: and so His Highness passed on in royal and
imperial manner.</p>

<p>At this time, that honourable old Knight Sir <span class="smcap">Henry
Leigh</span> met with His Majesty, being attended by sixty
gallant men well mounted on fair horses, thirty of them
being great horses: many of his men having chains of gold;
the rest wearing yellow scarfs embroidered with these words,
<i>Constantia et fide</i>. To this old Knight, His Majesty spake very
lovingly: and so paced through his troops very well pleased.</p>

<p>The multitudes of people in high ways, fields, meadows,
closes, and on trees, were such that they covered the beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
of the fields; and so greedy were they to behold the countenance
of the King that, with much unruliness, they injured
and hurt one another. Some even hazarded to the danger
of death. But as uncivil as they were among themselves;
all the way, as His Majesty past [they welcomed him] with
shouts, and cries, and casting up of hats (of which many
never returned into the owners' hands).</p>

<p>He passed by them, over the fields; and came in at the
back side of the Charterhouse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thither being come, he was most royal received and
entertained by the Lord <span class="smcap">Thomas Howard</span>. Where was
such abundance of provision of all manner of things that
greater could not be; both of rare wild fowls, and many rare
and extraordinary banquets; to the great liking of His
Majesty, and contentment of the whole train.</p>

<p>He lay there four nights [<i>7th to 10th May 1603</i>]: in which
time the Lords of the Council often resorted thither, and sat
upon their serious affairs.</p>

<p>At his departure [<i>11th May 1603</i>], he made divers Knights,
whose names are these:</p>

<p>Upon Wednesday, the 11th of May 1603, His Majesty
set forward from the Charterhouse, to the Tower of London;
in going quietly on horseback to Whitehall, where he took
[his] barge.</p>

<p>Having shot the Bridge [<i>London Bridge</i>], his present
landing was expected at [the] Tower Stairs. But it pleased
His Highness to pass the Tower Stairs, towards St.
Katharine's: and there stayed on the water to see the
ordnance on the White Tower, commonly called <span class="smcap">Julius
Cæsar</span>'s Tower, being in number 20 pieces; [together]
with the great ordnance on Tower Wharf, being in number
100; and chambers to the number of 130, discharged off.
Of which all services were so sufficiently performed by the
Gunners, that a peal of so good order was never heard before:
which was most commendable to all sorts, and very acceptable
to the King.</p>

<p>Then his royal person arrived at his own Stairs, so called
the King's Stairs; and with him these Nobles, besides other
gallant Gentlemen of worthy note, viz:</p>

<p><span style= "margin-left:10.2em;">[<span class="smcap">Charles Howard</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>,] the
Lord Admiral,</span></p>

<p><span style= "margin-left:10.2em;">[<span class="smcap">Henry Percy</span>,] the Earl of <span class="smcap">Northumberland</span>,</span></p>

<p><span style= "margin-left:10.2em;">[<span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span>,] the Earl of <span class="smcap">Worcester</span>,
Lord <span class="smcap">Thomas Howard</span>, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>At his coming up the Stairs, the Sword was presented to
His Majesty by Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Coni[g]sby</span>, Gentleman
Usher of his Privy Chamber; and by the King delivered
to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Lenox</span>: who bare it before him into the
Tower.</p>

<p>Upon the Stairs, the Gentleman Porter delivered the Keys
of the Tower to [Sir <span class="smcap">John Peyton</span>] the Lieutenant of the
Tower; and the Lieutenant presented them accordingly
to the King's Majesty: who most graciously acknowledged
the most faithful discharge of the loyal and most great trust
put in him; so, taking him about the neck, [he] redelivered
them again.</p>

<p>After his repose in the Tower some [<i>i.e. about an</i>] hour;
it was His Majesty's pleasure to see some [of the] Offices:
as the Armory, the Wardrobe, the rich Artillery, and the
Church. And after, for recreation, he walked in the garden:
and so rested for that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, being Thursday and the 12th of May [1603]
he saw the Ordnance House; and after that, the Mint
Houses; and, last of all, the lions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, being Friday the 13th of May [1603], he
made these Lords and Knights following, viz:</p>

<p>In his Presence Chamber, before dinner.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Odes.</i><br />
[1606, and 1619.]</span>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The following twelve <i>Odes</i> made their first appearance in an undated
Volume of <i>Poems Lyrical and Pastoral</i>: but its date is fixed, as being
in 1606, mainly by the 11th <i>Ode</i> on <i>The Virginian Voyage</i>.</p>

<p>As will be seen from pages 358-359 of the Second Volume of this
Series; <span class="smcap">James I.</span>, on 10th April 1606, divided Virginia into two
Colonies. The Southern (34&deg; to 41&deg; N.), or First, Colony, he granted
to the London Company: and the Northern (38&deg; to 45&deg; N.), or Second,
Colony, to the Plymouth Company.</p>

<p>This 11th Ode must therefore have been written somewhat before
12th August 1606; as, on that day, the Plymouth Company sent off, for
North Virginia, Captain <span class="smcap">Henry Challon</span>'s ship: which was however
taken by the Spanish Plate Fleet, and its crew brought prisoners
into Spain.</p>

<p>Of these twelve <i>Odes</i>; Nos. 4 and 8 were not reprinted in the Second
Edition of 1619. The text of the other ten is largely that of that later
edition, which was carefully revised by <span class="smcap">Drayton</span>; who, amongst other
changes, added in it those Headings which are here inserted between
square brackets.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.3em;"><span class="smcap">ODes</span>
I have called these, the first of my few Poems;</span>
which how happy soever they prove, yet Criticism
itself cannot say, That the name is wrongfully
usurped. For (not to begin with Definitions,
against the Rule of Oratory; nor <i>ab ovo</i>, against
the Prescript of Poetry in a poetical argument: but somewhat
only to season thy palate with a slight description)
an Ode is known to have been properly a Song
moduled to the ancient harp: and neither too short-breathed,
as hastening to the end; nor composed of [the]
longest verses, as unfit for the sudden turns and lofty tricks
with which <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> used to manage it.</p>

<p>They are, as the Learned say, divers:</p>

<p>Some transcendently lofty; and far more high than the
Epic, commonly called the Heroic, Poem&mdash;witness those of the
inimitable <span class="smcap">Pindarus</span> consecrated to the glory and renown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
of such as returned in triumph from [the Games at]
Olympus, Elis, Isthmus, or the like.</p>

<p>Others, among the Greeks, are amorous, soft, and made
for chambers; as others for theatres: as were <span class="smcap">Anacreon</span>'s,
the very delicacies of the Grecian <span class="smcap">Erato</span>; which Muse
seemed to have been the Minion of that Teian old man,
which composed them.</p>

<p>Of a mixed kind were <span class="smcap">Horace</span>'s. And [we] may truly
therefore call these mixed; whatsoever else are mine: little
partaking of the high dialect of the first</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:15em;">Though we be <i>all</i> to seek</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;">Of <span class="smcap">Pindar</span>, that great Greek, [p. <a href="#Page_531">531</a>]
</span>
</p>

<p>nor altogether of <span class="smcap">Anacreon</span>; the Arguments being amorous,
moral, or what else the Muse pleaseth.</p>

<p>To write much in this kind neither know I how it will
relish: nor, in so doing, can I but injuriously presuppose
ignorance or sloth in thee; or draw censure upon myself
for sinning against the decorum of a Preface, by reading a
Lecture, where it is enough to sum the points. New they
are, and the work of Playing Hours: but what other commendation
is theirs, and whether inherent in the subject,
must be thine to judge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to act the Go-Between of my Poems and thy applause,
is neither my modesty nor confidence: that, oftener than
once, have acknowledged thee, kind; and do not doubt
hereafter to do somewhat in which I shall not fear thee,
just. And would, at this time, also gladly let thee understand
what I think, above the rest, of the last Ode of the
number; or, if thou wilt, Ballad in my book. For both
the great Master of Italian rymes <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span>, and our
<span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, and others of the Upper House of the Muses,
have thought their Canzons honoured in the title of a <i>Ballad</i>:
which for that I labour to meet truly therein with the old
English garb, I hope as ably to justify as the learned <span class="smcap">Colin
Clout</span> his <i>Roundelay</i>.</p>

<p>Thus requesting thee, in thy better judgment, to correct
such faults as have escaped in the printing; I bid thee
farewell.</p>

formerly he did to one sort of men so
doth he it to another sort; so that all may

[<i>Ps.</i> li. 4.]</span></p>

<p>Now therefore, by his grace and assistance, I shall truly
set down the grounds my actions moved upon during that
unhappy War; and those actions which seemed to the
World the more questionable in my steering through the
turbulent and perilous seas of that time.</p>

<p>The first embarking into the sad calamities of War was
about the year 1641 when the general distemper of the Three
Kingdoms had kindled such a flame even in the hearts (I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
mean the Difference between the King and Parliament),
as every one sought to guard his own house by the authority
of both these. But the different judgements and ways were
so contrary that, before a remedy could be found out, almost
all was consumed to ashes.</p>

<p>I must needs say my judgement was for the Parliament,
as the King's, and Kingdom's, great and safest Council; as
others were for the King, and averse to Parliament, as if
it could not go high enough for the Perogative.</p>

<p>Upon which division, different Powers were set up, viz.:
The Commission of Array for the King; and [the Militia
for] the Parliament. But those of the Array so exceeded
their Commission by oppressing many honest people; whom,
by way of reproach, they called Roundheads: they being
(for Religion, Estates, and Interest) a very considerable part
of the country; that occasioned them to take up arms in
their own defence, which was afterwards confirmed by Parliamentary
authority.</p>

<p>Now my father being yet at his house at Denton, where I
then waited on him, though he had notice from his friends
that it was resolved that he should be sent for, as a prisoner,
to York: yet he resolved not to stir from his own house;
not knowing anything in himself to deserve it. But the
country [<i>Yorkshire</i>] suffering daily more and more, many
were forced to come and intreat him to join with them in
defence of themselves and country [<i>Yorkshire</i>]; which [were]
being sadly oppressed by those of the Array, which afterwards
had the name of Cavaliers.</p>

<p>And being much importuned by those that were about
him; he was resolved, seeing his country [<i>Yorkshire</i>] in this
great distress, to run the same hazard with them for the preservation
of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then did the Parliament grant a Commission to him, to
be General of the Forces in the North: myself also having
a Commission under him, to be General of the Horse. But
it is not my intention, in this place, to mention the several
Services that were done in this Cause of the Parliament:
being rather desirous to clear my actions in it than to declare
them. Therefore I shall say no more [<i>See however pp. <a href="#Page_577">577-610</a></i>]
of this Three Years' War in the North; there being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
nothing, I thank GOD! in all that time to be alleged
against me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now I shall come to say something how I came to be
engaged in the South.</p>

<p>There being some years spent, in those parts, in a lingering
War between the forces of the King and [the] Parliament;
and several battles so equally fought, as could scarce
be known on which side the business in dispute would be
determined; though it must be confessed the Parliament's
Army was under the command of a very noble and gallant
person, [<span class="smcap">Robert Devereux</span>] the Earl of <span class="smcap">Essex</span>: yet finding
Time and Delay gaining more advantage on their affairs
than Force had done; the Parliament resolved to make a
change in the constitution of their Army; hoping by it to
find a change also in businesses, which were then something
in a declining condition.</p>

<p>So as, in this distemper of affairs, the Army was New
Modelled; and a new General was proposed to command it.
For which, by the Votes of the Two Houses of Parliament
[in February 1645], myself was nominated; though most
unfit: and so far from desiring of it, that had not so great an
authority commanded obedience, [I also] being then unseparated
from the royal Interest; besides the persuasions
of nearest friends, not to decline so free and general a Call;
I should have "hid myself [among the stuff," 1 <i>Samuel</i> x.
22.] to have avoided so great a charge. But whether it was
from a natural facility in me, that betrayed my modesty; or
the powerful hand of GOD, which all things must obey: I
was induced to receive the Command.</p>

<p>Then was I immediately voted by the Parliament [in
February 1645], to come to London to take up my charge
[<i>where he arrived on 18th February 1645</i>]; though not fully
recovered of a dangerous wound, which I had received a
little before; and which, I verily believe, without the miraculous
hand of GOD had proved mortal.</p>

<p>But here, alas! when I bring to mind the sad consequences
that designing men have brought to pass since, from these
first innocent undertakings, I am ready to let go that confidence
I had, with <span class="smcap">Job</span> to say: "Till I die, I will not remove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
my integrity from me; nor shall my heart reproach me so
long as I live" [<i>Job</i> xxvii. 5]. But now more fit to take up
his Complaint with a little alteration and to say, Why did I
not die when I had that hurt? Why did I not give up the
ghost when my life was on the confines of the grave? [See
<i>Job</i> x. 18.]</p>

<p>But GOD having been pleased thus to give me my life as
a prey; I took my journey southward: hoping I might be
someway serviceable to the Public. But when I came
thither, had it not been in the simplicity of my heart, I could
not have supported myself under the frowns and displeasures
showed me by those who were disgusted at this alteration;
in which many of them were themselves so much concerned:
and these did not only outwardly express it, but sought by all
means to obstruct my proceedings in this new charge. Who
though they could not prevent what the necessity of affairs
pressed most to do, viz.: To march speedily out with the
Army; yet were we, by them, made so inconsiderable for
want of fit and necessary accommodations, as it rather
seemed that we were sent to be destroyed and ruined
than to do any service for the Kingdom by it. Insomuch
as when I went to take my leave of a Great Person [<i>Can this
have been <span class="smcap">Denzil Holles</span>?</i>]; he told me, He was very sorry
I was going out with the Army, for he did believe we should
be beaten.</p>

<p>Surely then had some of our ends been Self Interest
merely, this might have discouraged us: but it working no
such effects, gave the more hopes of future success; as it did
to the Parliament's advantage. But if any ill use hath been
made of such mercies, let the mercies be acknowledged from
GOD: but let the abuses receive their due reward of shame
and punishment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, being led on by good success, and clear intentions
of a Public Good; some of us could not discern the serpent
which was hid in these spreading leaves of so Good Fortune:
nor could believe the fruits of our hopes would prove as
cockatrice's eggs; from whence so viperous a brood should
afterwards spring up.</p>

<p>But, how ill deserving so ever we were: yet still it pleased
GOD to give the Army such success in the years [16]45 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
[16]46; that there remained in England neither Army nor
fortress to oppose the Parliament in settling the peace of
the Kingdom.</p>

<p>But this shining mercy soon became clouded with the
mists of abominable hypocrisy [and] deceit; even in those
men, who had been instrumental in bringing this War to a
conclusion. Here was the vertical point on which the
Army's honour and reputation turned into reproach and
scandal. Here the power of the Army, which I once had,
was usurped by the Forerunners of Confusion and Anarchy,
viz.: the Agitators. [<i>The Army appointed a Committee of
Adjutators on 14th May 1647.</i>]</p>

<p>My Commission as General bound me to act with [the
co-operation of my] Council: but the arbitrary and unlimited
power of this new Council would act without a General: and
all that I could do, could not prevail against this stream;
especially when the Parliament itself became divided, so
that the pay was withheld from the Army, which heightened
their distempers.</p>

<p>Then followed, Free Quarter [in November 1647]; and
that brought a general discontent through the whole nation:
which gave these factious Agitators matter enough for the
carrying on of their designs; viz., To raise their own fortunes
by the ruin of others.</p>

<p>But now, being much troubled to see things in this condition,
I did rather desire to be a sufferer than to be a Commander:
but, before I laid down my Commission, I thought
it fit to consult with some friends rather than gratify my
private sense and reason, which much desired it; especially
having received it from a Public Authority, which might
justly expect to have notice of it before I laid it down.
Which was the cause of my continuing in the Army longer
than I would have done (seeing I could not have my desire
granted): which did indeed preserve the Parliament for some
time, from those confusions and breakings, which afterwards
Time and Confidence emboldened these men to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now I shall descend to some particulars of their
Agitation:</p>

<p>At Nottingham was the first time that I took notice of it,
by the soldiers' meetings to frame a <i>Petition</i> to the Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
about their arrears [of pay]. The thing seemed just: but,
not liking the way, I spake with some Officers that were
principally engaged in it; and got it suppressed for that
time.</p>

<p>Which was but as the cutting off of Hydra's head, which
soon sprang up again (though not so near the Head Quarters;
but in more remote corners of the Army, which I could not
so timely prevent) so that they presented it to the Parliament;
which they were highly displeased with. And now
falling into difference[s]; the consequence of which proved
fatal not only to the King, but also destructive to one another.
The one striving to uphold his authority: the other (who had
a spirit of unsettlement) to preserve themselves from the ruin
they feared. This (with a natural inclination to change) I
believe created the thoughts of a New Government; which,
in time, attained the name of a Common Wealth: though
it never arrived to the perfection of it; being sometimes
Democratical, sometimes Oligarchial, lastly Anarchial&mdash;as
indeed all the ways attaining to it seemed nothing but a
Confusion.</p>

<p>For now the Officers of the Army were placed and displaced
by the will of the new Agitators; who, with violence,
so carried all things, as it was above my power to restrain
it. This made me have recourse to my friends to get me a
discharge of my Command; so as there was a consultation
with several Members of Parliament, who met about it: but
none would undertake to move it to the House, as affairs
then stood. And they perceiving that such a Motion would
be unpleasing to them: which was the answer I received
from them. And further that I should satisfy myself: for
it would be the Parliament's care to compose all things in as
good order as might be most for the good and settlement of
the Kingdom. But these hopes, though they something
supported my spirit; yet could not they balance the grief
and trouble I had, that I could not get my discharge. So
that, if you find me carried on with this stream; I can truly
say, It was by the violence of it, and no consent of mine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the Army, having gotten this power and strength by
correspondence with some in Parliament (who themselves
did after find it [to their disadvantage] in the end) they [<i>the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
<i>Army</i>] march nearer London [26th June 1647]: and, at
Windsor [20th November 1647], after two days' debate in a
Council of War, it was resolved to remove all out of the
House [of Commons] whom they conceived to "obstruct,"
as they called it, "the Public Settlement."</p>

<p>Upon which expedition in this march, I was vehemently
pressed: but here I resolved to use a restrictive power, when
I had not a persuasive one. So when the Lieutenant General
[<i>Oliver Cromwell</i>] and others pressed me to sign orders
for marching, I still delayed the doing of it [in November
1647]; as always dreading the consequences of breaking
Parliament, and at a time when the Kingdom was falling
into a new War: which was so near, that my delaying but
three or four days giving out Orders, diverted this humour
of the Army from being Statesmen to their more proper
duty of soldiers.</p>

<p>For, even then, Colonel <span class="smcap">Poyer</span> declared [for the King] in
Wales; great forces were raised with the Lord <span class="smcap">Goring</span> in
Kent; and Duke [of] <span class="smcap">Hamilton</span> (almost at the same time)
with a powerful Army of the Scots. All which set out work
enough for that summer [of 1648].</p>

<p>This I write to shew how, by Providence, a few days' delay
did prolong the Parliament more than a year from the violent
breaches that afterwards happened to them.</p>

<p>Here again might be mentioned the great and difficult
businesses the Army went through that year [1648]: hoping,
as well aiming, it would be a good service to the Kingdom.
But, seeing the factious Party grew more insolent as success
made them more powerful, I shall forbear to relate those
Actions; which would, otherwise, have deserved a better
remembrance than, in modesty, [it] were fit for me to record:
and [I] will rather punish myself here, with the continuance
of the Story of the Army's Irregularities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But one thing, of very great concernment in all after
changes, should have been inserted before the mention of
this Second War: but [it] will come in well enough in this
place, without much interruption of this Discourse, viz.:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">THE KING'S REMOVAL FROM HOLMBY,</span>
</p>

<p>the sad consequences whereof fill my heart with grief with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
the remembrance of it now; as it did then, with thoughts
and care how to have prevented it.</p>

<p>Being then at Saffron Walden in Essex, I had notice that
Cornet <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (an arch-Agitator that quartered about Oxford)
had [on 4th June 1647] seized on the King's person, and
removed his Quarters: and [had] given such a check to the
Commissioners of Parliament which were ordered to attend
His Majesty, that they refused to act any further in their
Commission; being so unwarrantably interrupted.</p>

<p>But, as soon as I heard it, I immediately sent away two
Regiments of Horse, commanded by Colonel <span class="smcap">Whalley</span> to
remove this force; and to set all things again in their due
order and course.</p>

<p>But before he reached Holmby [or Holdenby]; the King
was advanced two or three miles [from thence] on his way
towards Cambridge; attended by <span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Here Colonel
<span class="smcap">Whalley</span> acquainted the King, That he was sent by the
General to let him know how much he was troubled at
those great insolencies that had been committed so near his
person: and as he had not the least knowledge of it before
it was done, so he had omitted no time in seeking to remove
the force; which he had orders from me to see done. And
therefore [Colonel <span class="smcap">Whalley</span>] desired that His Majesty would
be pleased to return again to Holmby, where all things should
again be settled in as much order and quietness as they were
before. And also he [<i>Colonel <span class="smcap">Whalley</span></i>] desired the Commissioners
to resume their Charge, as the Parliament had
directed them: which he had in charge also to desire them
to do, from the General.</p>

<p>But the King refused to return; and the Commissioners
refused also to act any more as Commissioners. Which
Colonel <span class="smcap">Whalley</span> still further urged, saying, He had an
express command to see all things well settled again about
His Majesty; which could not be but by his returning again
to Holmby.</p>

<p>Which the King said positively, He would not do.</p>

<p>So Colonel <span class="smcap">Whalley</span> pressed him no further: having
indeed a special direction from me to use all tenderness
and respect, as was due, towards His Majesty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the King came that night, or the second [6th June
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
1647] to Sir <span class="smcap">John Cutt</span>'s house [at Childerley] near
Cambridge: where, the next day, I waited on His Majesty.
It being also my business to persuade his return to Holmby.
But he was otherwise resolved.</p>

<p>I pressed the Commissioners also to act again, according
to the power that Parliament had given them: which they
also refused to do.</p>

<p>So having spent the whole day [7th June 1647] about this
business; I returned to my Quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But before I took my leave of the King, he said to me,
"Sir, I have as great an Interest in the Army as you." By
which I plainly saw the broken reed he leaned upon.</p>

<p>These Agitators [<i>or Adjutators</i>], chameleon-like, could
change into that colour which best served their ends; and
so had brought the King into an opinion that the Army was
for him: though [it was] never less for his safety and rights,
than when it was theirs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And that it might appear what real trouble this act was to
me; notwithstanding the Army was almost wholly infected
with the humour of Agitation, I called for a Court of War, to
proceed against <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> for this high offence, and the breach
of the <i>Articles of War</i>. But the Officers (whether for fear
of the distempered soldiers; or rather, as I fear, from a secret
allowance of what was done) made all my endeavours herein
ineffectual: and now (no punishment being able to reach
them) all affairs steer after this compass:</p>

<p>The King and all his Party are in hopes. Those of the
Parliament, and others who kept to their Covenant Interest,
in fears. So as, for many months, Public Councils were
turned into private Junto's. Which would have been less
criminal, if it had ended in General Consent. But, on the
contrary, it begat greater emulations and jealousies one of
another. So that the Army would not entrust the King any
longer with the liberty he had; nor would the Parliament
suffer the King to undertake that which was properly their
work to do, viz.: [the] Settling [of] the Kingdom with its just
rights and liberties. And the Army were as jealous of the
Parliament, that they [<i>the Parliament</i>] would not have care
enough of their [<i>the Army's</i>] security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>All things growing worse and worse made the King
endeavour his own escape, as he did [11th-14th November
1647]; but out of a larger confinement at Hampton Court,
to a straiter one in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Here the Parliament treated upon <i>Propositions of Peace</i>
with the King. But, alas, the Envious One sowed tares
that could not be rooted out, without plucking up the corn
also.</p>

<p>And here was the King, as the golden ball, tossed before
the two great Parties; the Parliament, and the Army:
[which] grew to a great contest, which must again have
involved the kingdom in blood.</p>

<p>But the Army, having the greater power, got the King
again into their hands; notwithstanding all the means that
could be used. The <i>Treaty</i> [<i>? of Newport, ? October 1648</i>]
was scarcely ended, before the King was seized upon by the
hands of the same person, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>,
who took him from Holmby [; <i>and who now removed him,
on 1st December 1648, from Carisbrooke Castle to Hurst
Castle</i>]. Soon after followed his Trial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to prepare a way to this work [<i>the Trial</i>] this Agitating
Council had thought first how to remove out of the Parliament
all those who were likely to oppose them in that
work; which they carried on with that secrecy as that I had
not the least intimation of it, till it was done: as some
Members of the House can witness, with whom I was met,
at that very time, upon especial business, when that horrible
attempt was made by Colonel <span class="smcap">Pride</span> upon the Parliament
[on 6th December 1648]. It was so secretly carried on that
I should get no notice of it: because I always prevented
those designs when I knew of them. But by this "Purging
of the House," as they called it, the Parliament was brought
into such a consumptive and languishing condition as that it
could never recover again that healthful Constitution which
always kept the Kingdom in its strength and vigour.</p>

<p>But now, this Three-fold Cord being cut by the sword, the
Trial of the King was the easier for them to accomplish.
My afflicted and troubled mind for it, and my earnest
endeavours to prevent it, will, I hope, sufficiently testify
my abhorrence of the fact. And what might they not now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
do to the lower shrubs, having thus cut down the cedar?
For, after this, [the] Duke [of] <span class="smcap">Hamilton</span>, [the] Earl of
<span class="smcap">Holland</span>, and Lord <span class="smcap">Capel</span>, and others, were condemned
to death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But here it is fit to say something for my own vindication
about my Lord <span class="smcap">Capel</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Lucas</span>, and Sir
<span class="smcap">George Lisle</span>; who were <i>prisoners at mercy</i> upon the
rendition of Colchester: seeing some have questioned the
just performance of those <i>Articles</i> [<i>of Surrender</i>].</p>

<p>I (having laid siege to the town, and several assaults being
made upon it) finding their forces within [to be] much more
numerous than those I had without, forced me to take another
course: blocking them up; and so, by cutting off all supplies,
to bring them to a surrender. Which, after [a] four months'
siege, they were necessitated to; and that <i>upon mercy</i>: they
being between 3,000 and 4,000 men.</p>

<p>Now by <i>Delivering upon mercy</i> is to be understood, that
some are to suffer, and the rest to go free.</p>

<p>So those forementioned persons only were to suffer; and
all the rest freed.</p>

<p>So immediately after our entrance into the town [on 26th
August 1648], a Council of War being called; those persons
were sentenced to die, the rest to be quit.</p>

<p>Yet, on they being so resolved, I thought fit to manumit
the Lord <span class="smcap">Capel</span>, the Lord <span class="smcap">Norwich</span>, &amp;c. over to the Parliament
(being the Civil Judicature of the Kingdom, consisting
then of Lords and Commons) as the most proper Judges of
their cases: being considerable for estates and families.</p>

<p>But Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Lucas</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">George Lisle</span> being
mere Soldiers of Fortune; and falling into our hands by the
chance of war, execution was done upon them. And in this
distribution of Justice I did nothing but according to my
Commission, and the trust reposed in me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it may be objected that I went into the Court during
the Trial.</p>

<p>To this, I answer. It was upon the earnest entreaties of
my Lord <span class="smcap">Capel</span>'s friends; who desired me to explain there,
what I meant by <i>Surrendering to mercy</i>: otherwise I had
not gone, being always unsatisfied with the Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p>But for this I shall need to say no more: seeing I may as
well be questioned for the <i>Articles</i> of Bristol, Oxford, Exeter;
or [for] any other Action in the War, as for this.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now I have related the most remarkable things that
might be alleged against me during the prosecution of the
War.</p>

<p>Yet one thing more requires that I should say something
to it, before I conclude, viz.: Concerning Papers and Declarations
of the Army that came out in my name and the
Council of Officers. I must needs say. From the time they
declared their Usurped Authority at Triplow Heath [10th
June 1647], I never gave my free consent to anything they
did: but (being then undischarged of my place) they set my
hand [<i>signature</i>] by way of course, to all their Papers;
whether I consented or not.</p>

<p>And unto such failings all Authority may fall. As sometimes
Kingly Authority may be abused to their, and the
Kingdom's, prejudice; sometimes, under a Parliamentary
Authority, much injury hath been done: so here, hath a
General's Power been broken and crumbled into a Levelling
Faction, to the great unsettlement of the Nation.</p>

<p>Yet, even in this, I hope all impartial judges will interpret
as a force and ravishment of a good name; rather than a
voluntary consent whereby it might make me seem to become
equally criminal. Though I must confess, if in a
multitude of words, much more in a multitude of actions,
there may be some transgressions: yet, I can as truly say,
they were never designedly or wilfully committed by me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now, when all the power was got into the Army, they
cut up the root of Kingly Government. After this, were
Engagements to relinquish the Title. Then [was] War
declared against Scotland for assisting the King [<span class="smcap">Charles</span>
II.]: and several Leagues made with foreign Princes to confederate
with their new Government, which was now a
Common Wealth, against the Kingly Power.</p>

<p>Seeing which, with grief and sorrow, though I had as
much the love of the Army as ever; though I was with
much importunity solicited by the remaining Parliament,
the Lieutenant General [<span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>], and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
Officers and soldiers, to continue my Command; and
though I might, so long as I acted their designs, attain to
the height of power and other advantages I pleased (for so I
understood from themselves): yet (by the mercy and goodness
of GOD, ever valuing Loyalty and Conscience before
this perishing felicity) I did, so long as I continued in the
Army, oppose all those ways in their counsels; and, when I
could do no more, I also declined their actions, though not
their Commission I had from the Parliament, till the remaining
part of it, took it from me [25th June 1650].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus I have given you, in short, the sum of the most
considerable things that the World may censure me for,
during this unhappy War. Yet, I hope, among many weaknesses
and failings there shall not be found crimes of that
magnitude [for me] to be counted amongst those who have
done these things through ambition and dissimulation.
Hoping also that GOD will, one day, clear this Action we
undertook, so far as concerns his honour; and the integrity
of such as faithfully served in it. For I cannot believe that
such wonderful successes shall be given in vain. Though
cunning and deceitful men must take shame to themselves;
yet the purposes and determination of GOD shall have
happy effects to his glory, and the comfort of his people.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I did</span> not think to have taken up my pen
any more, to have written on this subject:
but that my silence seemed to accuse me
of ingratitude to GOD for the many
mercies and deliverances I have had; and
of injuriousness to myself in losing the
comfort of them, by suffering them to be
buried in the grave of Oblivion in my
lifetime.</p>

<p>Wherefore I shall set down, as they come to my mind,
such things wherein I have found the wonderful assistance
of GOD to me in the time of the War I was in the North:
though not in that methodical and polished manner as might
have been done; being but intended only for my own satisfaction,
and the help of my memory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I said, in the First Part [<i>p. <a href="#Page_565">565</a></i>], my father was called
forth by the importunity of the country [<i>Yorkshire</i>], to join
with them in the defence of themselves: and [was] confirmed
by a Commission of the Parliament [<i>by Vote on the 23rd
August 1642. He however did not actually receive the Commission
till the 3rd December following.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first Action we had was at Bradford, where we had
about 300 men. The Enemy, having about 700 or 800 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
2 pieces of ordnance, came thither to assault us [in October
1642]. We drew out close to the town to receive them.
They had [the] advantage of [the] ground, the town being
compassed with hills; which made us more exposed to their
cannon shot, from which we received some hurt. Yet notwithstanding,
our men defended the passages, which they
[<i>the Enemy</i>] were to descend, so well that they got no
ground of us. And now, the day being spent, they drew off;
and returned back again to Leeds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days after, Captain <span class="smcap">Hotham</span>, with 3 Troops of
Horse and some Dragoons, came to me; and then we
marched to Leeds. But the Enemy, having notice of it,
quitt[ed] the town in haste; and fled to York.</p>

<p>And that we might have more room, and be less burthensome
to our friends; we presently advanced [in November
1642] to Tadcaster, 8 miles from York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now we being increased to 1,000 men, it was thought fit, for
securing of the West Riding, at least the greatest part of it,
from whence our greatest supply came, to keep the Pass at
Wetherby; whither my father sent me with about 300 Foot
and 40 Horse. The Enemy's next design, from York, was
to fall on my Quarters there; which was a place very open
and easy for them to do: there being so many back ways to
enter in; and friends enough to direct and acquaint them
with all we did.</p>

<p>About six of the clock in the morning [in November 1642],
they set upon us with 800 Horse and Foot. The woods
thereabouts favoured them so much as that our Scouts could
get no notice of them; so as no alarm was given till they
were ready to enter the town, which they might soon do for
the Guards were all asleep in houses.</p>

<p>For in the beginning of the War, men were as impatient
of Duty as ignorant of it.</p>

<p>Myself only was on horseback; going out, at the other
end of the town, to Tadcaster: where my father lay.</p>

<p>One came running to me, and told me, The Enemy was
entering the town. I presently galloped to the Court of
Guard [<i>the Piquet</i>], where I found not above four men at
their arms; as I remember, two Foot Sergeants and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
Pike men, [who] withstood with me when Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Glenham</span>,
with about six or seven Commanders more, charged
us: where, after a short but sharp encounter, in which Major
<span class="smcap">Carr</span> was slain, they retired. And in this time more of the
Guard were gotten to their arms. But I must confess I
know [of] no strength, but the powerful hand of GOD, that
gave them this repulse.</p>

<p>Afterward they made another attempt, in which Captain
<span class="smcap">Atkinson</span> was slain.</p>

<p>And here again, there fell out another remarkable Providence.
During this conflict, our Magazine was blown up:
which struck such a terror in the Enemy, thinking we had
cannon (which they were informed we had not), that they
instantly retreated. And though I had but a few Horse;
they pursued the Enemy some miles, and took many
prisoners.</p>

<p>We lost about eight or ten men, whereof seven were
blown up with [the] powder: the Enemy, many more.
<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time [<span class="smcap">Henry Clifford</span>] the Earl of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>
commanded the Forces in Yorkshire for the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span></p>

<p>
But (being of a peaceable nature; and by his amiable disposition
having but few enemies, or rather because he was
an enemy to few) he did not suit with their present condition
and apprehension of fears. Therefore they sent to [<span class="smcap">William
Cavendish</span>] the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, who had an Army
of 6,000 men, to desire his assistance: which he answered
by a speedy march to York.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Being now encouraged by this increase of force, they
resolved to fall on Tadcaster. My father drew all his men
thither. But by a Council of War the town was judged
untenable; and that we should draw out to an advantageous
piece of ground by the town. But before we could all march
out; the Enemy advanced [on 7th December 1642] so fast
that we were necessitated to leave some Foot in a slight
Work above the bridge to secure our retreat.
</p>
<p>
But the Enemy pressing still on us, forced us to draw back
[<i>return back</i>], and maintain that ground.
</p>
<p>
We had about 900 men. The Enemy above 4,000: who,
in Brigades, drew up close to the Works, and stormed us.
Our men reserved their shot till they were very near; which
then they disposed to so good purpose as forced them to
retire, and shelter themselves behind the hedges that were
hard by.
</p>
<p>
And here did the fight continue from 11 a clock at noon
till 5 at night, with cannon and musket, without intermission.
</p>
<p>
They had, once, possessed a house by the bridge; which
would have cut us [off] from our reserves that were in the
town: but Major General <span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, with a commanded
party, beat them out again; where many of the enemies
were slain and taken prisoners.
</p>
<p>
They attempted at another place; but were also repulsed
by Captain <span class="smcap">Lister</span>, who was there slain: which was a great
loss, [he] being a discreet Gentleman.
</p>
<p>
And now, it growing dark, the Enemy drew off into the
fields hard by; with intention to assault us again the next
day. They left that night about 200 dead and wounded
upon the place.
</p>
<p>
But our ammunition being all spent in this day's fight;
we drew off that night, and marched to Selby: and the
Enemy entered, the next day [8th December 1642], into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
town [of Tadcaster]. And thus, by the mercy of GOD, were
a few delivered from an Army who, in their thoughts, had
swallowed us up.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Now, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> lay between us and our
friends in the West Riding; and so [was] equally destructive
to us both. But, to give them encouragement and help, I
was sent [on Friday, 9th December 1642], with about 200
Foot and 3 Troops of Horse and some arms, to Bradford.
I was to go by Ferrybridge: our intelligence being that the
Enemy was advanced yet no further than Sherburn.
</p>
<p>
But when I was within a mile of the town [<i>i.e. Ferrybridge</i>];
we took some prisoners who told us That my Lord
<span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> laid at Pontefract, 800 men in Ferrybridge, and
the rest of the Army in all the towns thereabouts.
</p>
<p>
So as now, our advance, or retreat, seemed [to be] alike
difficult. But, there being not much time to demur in, a
retreat was resolved on back again to Selby. 300 or 400 of
the Enemy's Horse shewed themselves in our rear, without
making any attempt upon us; and so, through the goodness
of GOD, we got safe thither.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Here, chronologically, comes in the Fight at Sherburn in Elmet,
on Wednesday, 14th December 1642, described at page <a href="#Page_584">584</a>.</i>]
</p>
<p>
And, in three days after,
<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> having better intelligence how
they lay, with the same number as before, I marched in the
night by several towns where they lay, and arrived, the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
day, at Bradford: a town very untenable; but, for their good
affections, deserving all we could hazard for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></p>

<p>Our first work there was to fortify ourselves; for we could
not but expect strong opposition in it: seeing there lay at
Leeds 1,500 of the Enemy, and 1,200 at Wakefield; neither
above six or seven miles from us. They visited us every day
with their Horse; for ours went not far from the town, being
so unequal in number: yet they seldom returned without
loss. Till, at length, our few men grew so bold; and theirs,
so disheartened: as they durst not stir a mile out of their
garrison.</p>

<p>But while these daily skirmishes were among the Horse;
I thought it necessary to strengthen ourselves with more
Foot. So, summoning the country [<i>i.e. the West Riding of
Yorkshire</i>], which now our Horse had given some liberty to
come into us; I presently armed them with the arms we
brought along with us: so that, in all, we were now about
800 Foot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But being too many to lie idle, and yet too few to be in
continual duty; we resolved rather, through the assistance
of GOD, to attempt them in their garrison than endure
longer this trouble. So summoning the country in again;
we made a body of about 1,200 or 1,300 men: with which
we marched to Leeds, and drew them up [on Monday, 23rd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
January 1643] within [a] half cannon shot of their Works, in
Battalia; and then sent in a Trumpet[er] with a Summons
to deliver up the town to me, for the use of [the] King and
Parliament.</p>

<p>They presently returned this answer, That it was not
civilly done to come so near before I sent the Summons; and
that they would defend the town, the best they could, with
their lives.</p>

<p>So presently ordering the manner of the Storm, we all fell
on at one time. The business was hotly disputed for almost
two hours: but, after, the Enemy were beaten from their
Works. The Barricadoes were soon forced open into the
streets: where Horse and Foot resolutely entering, the
soldiers cast down their arms, and rendered themselves
prisoners. The Governor and some chief Officers swam the
river and escaped. One Major <span class="smcap">Beaumont</span> was drowned,
as was thought. In all, there were about 40 or 50 slain;
and [a] good store of ammunition [was] taken, which we had
much want of.</p>

<p>But the consequence of this Action was yet of more
importance. For those that fled from Leeds and Wakefield,
(for they also quitted that garrison) gave my Lord <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>
such an alarm at Pontefract, where he lay; as he
drew all his Army back again to York: leaving once more
a free intercourse between my father [at Selby] and me,
which he had so long time cut off.</p>

<p>But, after a short time, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> returned
again to the same Quarters [at Pontefract]; and we to our
stricter duties.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, after some time, we found that our men must either
have more room, or more action. [<i>This Fight at Sherburn
took place on the 14th December 1642; and should have been
mentioned earlier in this Narrative.</i><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>] Therefore Captain

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>

<span class="smcap">Hotham</span> and I took a resolution, early in the morning to
beat up a Quarter [<i>Encampment</i>] of the Enemy that lay at
[Church] Fenton. But they being gone, we marched towards
Sherburn [in Elmet]; intending only to give them an alarm
there.</p>

<p>But they might see us, a mile or two, march over a plain
common which lay by the Town; and therefore had sent
about 20, or 30, Horse to guard a Pass near the town. I
having the Van (For, at this time we [<i><span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> and
<span class="smcap">Hotham</span></i>] commanded our Troops distinct one from
another; both making 5 Troops of Horse and 2 of
Dragoons), I told him, If he would second me, I would
charge those Horse; and if they fled, I would pursue
them so close[ly] as to get into the town with them. He
promised to second me. I went to the head of my Troops,
and presently charged them: who fled, and we pursued
[them] close to the Barricado. But they got in, and shut
it upon us; where my horse was shot at the breast. We so
filled the lane; being strait [<i>narrow</i>] that we could not
retreat without confusion, and danger of their falling in our
rear. So we stood to it; and stormed the Work with pistol
and sword. At the end of the Barricado, there was a straight
passage for one single horse to go in. I entered there, and
others followed one by one. Close at one side of the entrance
stood a Troop of Horse: but so soon as eight or ten of us
got in they fled. And by this time, the rest of our men had
beaten them from their Barricado, and entered the town,
which soon cleared the streets, and pursued those that fled.
And now my horse, which was shot in the lane, fell down
dead under me: but I was presently mounted again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span></p>

<p>They in the towns about having taken the alarm, now
made us think of securing our retreat with the prisoners
we had gotten: and some of them [were] very considerable;
among whom was Major General <span class="smcap">Windham</span>. But we
scarce[ly] got into good order before General <span class="smcap">Goring</span> came,
with a good body of Horse, up to us: and as we marched on,
he followed close in the rear, without [our] receiving any
hurt; only my Trumpet[er] had his horse shot close by me.
So we returned again to Selby.</p>

<p>But though this could not free us wholly from a potent
Enemy; yet we lay more quietly by them a good while
after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this recess of action, we had several treaties [<i>negotiations</i>]
about prisoners. And this I mention the rather, for
that Captain <span class="smcap">Hotham</span> here began to discover his intention
of leaving the Parliament's Service, by making conditions
for himself with the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> (though [it was]
not discovered till a good while after): which had almost
ruined my father, and the forces that were with him.</p>

<p>For, being now denied help and succour from Hull and the
East Riding; he was forced to forsake Selby, and retire to
Leeds and those western parts where [I] myself was.</p>

<p>But to make good this retreat, I was sent to, to bring what
men I could to join with him at Sherburn. For <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s
forces lay so, as he might easily intercept us in our
way to Leeds: which he had determined [to do], and to that
end lay with his Army on Clifford Moor; having perfect intelligence
of our march.</p>

<p>But while my father, with 1,500 men ordnance and ammunition,
continued [on 2nd April 1643] his way from Selby
to Leeds; I, with those I brought to Sherburn, marched a
little aside, between my Lord <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s Army and ours.
And to amuse [<i>deceive</i>] them the more, [I] made an attempt
upon Tadcaster: whither they had 300 or 400 men; who
presently quitted the town, and fled to York. Here we
stayed three or four hours sleighting [<i>destroying</i>] the Works.</p>

<p>This put <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s Army to a stand, which was on
their march to meet us: thinking that he was deceived in
his intelligence; and that we had some other design upon
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p>He presently sent back the Lord <span class="smcap">Goring</span>, with 20 Troops
of Horse and Dragoons, to relieve Tadcaster. We were
newly drawn off when they came. <span class="smcap">Goring</span> pressed over
the river to follow us.</p>

<p>But seeing we were far unequal to him in Horse, for I had
not above 3 Troops; and [having] to go over Bramham
Moor, a large plain: I gave direction to the Foot to march
away, while I stayed with the Horse to interrupt the Enemy's
passage in those narrow lanes that lead up to the Moor. Here
was much firing at one another. But, in regard of their great
number, as they advanced we were forced to give way: yet
had gained by it sufficient time for the Foot to be out of
danger.</p>

<p>But when we came up to the Moor again, I found them
where I left them: which troubled me much, the Enemy
being close upon us, and a great plain yet to go over. So
[I] marched the foot in two Divisions, and the Horse in the
rear. The Enemy followed, about two musket shot from us,
in three good bodies: but yet made no attempt upon us.
And thus we got well over the open <i>campania</i>.</p>

<p>But having again gotten to some little enclosures, beyond
which was another Moor, called Seacroft Moor [<i>now called
Whin Moor. It is about five miles from Leeds</i>], much less
than the first. Here our men thinking themselves more
secure, were more careless in keeping order; and while their
officers were getting them out of houses, where they sought
for drink, [it] being an exceedingly hot day; the Enemy got,
another way, as soon as we, on to the Moor. But we had
almost passed this plain also.</p>

<p>They [<i>the Royalists</i>] seeing us in some disorder, charged us
both in Flank and Rear. The countrymen presently cast
down their arms, and fled. The Foot soon after: which, for
want of pikes, were not able to withstand their Horse. Some
were slain; and many taken prisoners. Few of our Horse
stood the charge. Some Officers, with me, made our retreat
with much difficulty; in which Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Foulis</span> had a
slight hurt. My Cornet was taken prisoner. Yet [we] got
to Leeds about two hours after my father, with those forces
with him, was arrived safe thither.</p>

<p>This was one of the greatest losses we ever received. Yet
was it a great Providence that it was a part, and not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
whole, [of the] Force which received this loss: it being the
Enemy's intention to have fought us that day with their
whole Army, which was, at least, 10,000 men; had not the
Attempt at Tadcaster put a stand to them. And so concluded
that day with this storm that fell on us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now, being at Leeds, it was thought fit to possess
some other place also: wherefore I was sent to Bradford,
with 700 or 800 Foot and 3 Troops of Horse. These two
towns being all the garrisons we had. At Wakefield, six
miles off, lay 3,000 of the Enemy: but yet [we] had not
much disturbance from them.</p>

<p>Being most busied about releasing our prisoners that were
taken at Seacroft Moor, most of them being countrymen
[<i>Yorkshire peasants</i>]; whose wives and children were still
importunate for their release: which was as earnestly endeavoured
by us; but no conditions would be accepted. So their
continual cries, and tears, and importunities compelled us to
think of some way to redeem these men: so as we thought
of attempting Wakefield; our intelligence being that the
Enemy had not above 800 or 900 men in the town.</p>

<p>I acquainted my father with our design: who approved
of it; and sent [to Bradford] some men from Leeds; which
enable us to draw out 1,100 Horse and Foot.</p>

<p>So upon Whit-Sunday [21st May 1643], early in the morning,
we came before the town. But they had notice of our
coming, and had manned all their Works, and set about 800
Musketeers to line the hedges about the town: which made
us now doubt our intelligence; which was too late. Notwithstanding,
after a little consultation, we advanced, and
soon beat them back into the town; which we stormed in
three places.</p>

<p>After two hours' dispute, the Foot forced open a Barricado,
where I entered with my own Troop. Colonel <span class="smcap">Alured</span>, and
Captain <span class="smcap">Bright</span>, followed with theirs. The street which we
entered was full of their Foot: which we charged through,
and routed; leaving them to the Foot which followed close
behind us. And presently we were charged again with
Horse led by General <span class="smcap">Goring</span>: where, after a hot encounter,
some were slain; and [he] himself taken prisoner by [the
brother of] Colonel <span class="smcap">Alured</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p>And I cannot but here acknowledge GOD's goodness to
me this day: who being advanced a good way single [<i>alone</i>]
before my men, having a Colonel and a Lieutenant Colonel,
who had engaged themselves to be my prisoners, only with
me; and many of the enemies between me and my men, I
light[ed] on a Regiment of Foot standing in the Market
Place.</p>

<p>Thus encompassed, and thinking what to do; I espied a
lane which I thought would lead me back to my men again.
At the end of this lane, there was a Corps du Guard [<i>Piquet</i>]
of the Enemy's, with 15 or 16 soldiers; who were then just
quitting it, with a Serjeant leading them off: whom we met.
Who, seeing their [two] Officers, came up to us; taking no
notice of me. They asked them, What they would have
them do? for they could keep the Work no longer; because
the Roundheads, as they called them, came so fast upon
them.</p>

<p>But the Gentlemen, who had passed their words to me to
be my true prisoners, said nothing. So, looking upon one
another, I thought it not fit now to own them; as so much
less to bid the rest to render themselves to me: so, being
well mounted, and seeing a place in the Work where men
used to go over, I rushed from them, seeing no other remedy,
and made my horse leap over the Work. And so, by a good
Providence, got to my men again: who, before I came, had,
by the direction of Major General <span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, brought up a
piece of ordnance, and planted it in the Churchyard, against
the body that stood in the Market Place; who presently
rendered themselves.</p>

<p>All our men being got into the town, the streets were
cleared, [and] many prisoners taken. But the Horse got
off almost entire. But this seemed the greater mercy when
we saw our mistake: now finding 3,000 men in the town,
[and] not expecting half the number. We brought away
1,400 prisoners, 80 Officers, 28 Colours; and [a] great store
of ammunition, which we much wanted.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p>But seeing this was more a Miracle than a Victory; more
the effect of GOD's divine power than human force; and
more his Providence than the success of our prudence in
making so hazardous an attempt: let the honour and praise
of it be His only!</p>

<p>After this, we exchanged our men that were prisoners,
with these: and were freed, a good while; from any trouble
or attempt from [the] Enemy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But then again it pleased GOD to mix water with our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
wine; and to bring us into a better condition by the brinks
of ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>Hitherto, through His mercy, we had held up near[ly] two
years against a potent Army: but they finding us now
almost tired, with continual Services; treacherously used by
our friends; and in want of many things necessary for
support and defence&mdash;the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> marched
with an Army of 10,000 or 12,000 men to besiege us;
and resolved to sit down before Bradford, which was a
very untenable place.</p>

<p>My father drew all the forces he could spare out of the
garrisons hither.</p>

<p>But seeing it impossible to defend the town but by
strength of men; and not [having] above ten or twelve
days' provisions for so many as were necessary to keep it:
we resolved [on 29th June 1643] the next morning, very
early, with a party of 3,000 men, to attempt his whole Army,
as they lay in their Quarters, three miles off; hoping thereby,
to put him into some distraction; which could not, by reason
of the unequal numbers, be done any other way.</p>

<p>For this end, my father appointed four of the clock next
morning [30th June 1643] to begin the march. But Major
General [<span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, who had the ordering of the
business, so delayed the execution of it that it was seven
or eight before we began to move: and not without much
suspicion of treachery in it; for when we came near the
place we intended, the Enemy's whole Army was drawn up
in Battalia.</p>

<p>We were to go up a hill to them, which our Forlorn Hope
[<i>or Advanced Guard</i>] gained by beating theirs into their
Main Body; which was drawn up half a mile further, upon
a plain called Adderton [<i>the correct spelling is Adwalton</i>]
Moor. [<i>It is also spelt Atherston and Atherton.</i>]</p>

<p>We, being all up the hill, drew into Battalia also. I commanded
the Right Wing, which was about 1,000 Foot and
5 Troops of Horse; Major General [<span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, the
Left Wing, which was about the same number. My father
commanded all in chief.</p>

<p>We advanced through the enclosed grounds till we came
to the Moor; beating the Foot that lay in them to their
Main Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p>10 or 12 Troops of Horse charge us in the Right Wing
[<i>which was at the head of Warren's Lane</i>]. We kept [to]
the enclosures, placing our Musketeers in the hedges next
the Moor; which was a good advantage to us, that had so
few Horse.</p>

<p>There was a gate, or open place, to the Moor: where five
or six might enter abreast. Here they strove to enter: we,
to defend. But, after some dispute, those that entered the
pass found sharp entertainment; and those that were not
yet entered, as hot welcome from the Musketeers, that
flanked them in the hedges. All, in the end, were forced to
retreat; with the loss of Colonel <span class="smcap">Howard</span>, who commanded
them.</p>

<p>The Left Wing, at the same time, was engaged with the
Enemy's Foot. Ours gained ground of them.</p>

<p>The Horse came down again, and charged us: being about
13 or 14 Troops. We defended ourselves as before; but
with much more difficulty, many having got in among us:
but [they] were beat[en] off again, with some loss; and
Colonel <span class="smcap">Herne</span>, who commanded that party, was slain.
We pursued them [back] to their cannon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here I cannot omit a remarkable passage of Divine
Justice. Whilst we were engaged in the fight with those
Horse that entered the gate, four soldiers had stripped
Colonel <span class="smcap">Herne</span> naked; as he lay dead on the ground, [and]
men still fighting round about him: and so dextrous were
these villains, as they had done it, and mounted themselves
again, before we had beaten them off. But after we had
beaten them to their ordnance, as I said; and [were] now
returning to our ground again; the Enemy discharged a
piece of cannon in our rear. The bullet fell into Captain
<span class="smcap">Copley</span>'s Troop, in which these four men were: two of
whom were killed; and some hurt or mark remained on the
rest, though dispersed into several Ranks of the Troop, which
was [the] more remarkable.</p>

<p>We had not yet Martial Law amongst us: which gave me
a good occasion to reprove it; by shewing the soldiers the
sinfulness of the act, and how GOD would punish when men
wanted power to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p>This charge, and the resolution our soldiers shewed in the
Left Wing, made the Enemy think of retreating. Orders
were given for it; and some marched off the Field.</p>

<p>Whilst they were in this wavering condition, one Colonel
<span class="smcap">Skirton</span>, a wild and desperate man, desired his General to
let him charge [on our Left Wing] once more, with a Stand
of Pikes. With which he brake in upon our men; and they
not [being] relieved by our Reserves, ([which were] commanded
by some ill-affected Officers; chiefly Major General
<span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, who did not his part as he ought to do), our men
lost ground: which the Enemy seeing, pursued this advantage
by bringing on fresh troops. Ours, being herewith
discouraged, began to flee; and so [were] soon routed.</p>

<p>The Horse also charged us again. We, not knowing what
was done in the Left Wing; our men maintained their
ground till a command came for us to retreat: having
scarce any way now to do it; the Enemy being almost
round about us, and our way to Bradford cut off. But there
was a lane [<i>Warren's Lane</i>] in the field we were in, which
led to Halifax: which, as a happy Providence, brought us
off without any great loss; save of Captain <span class="smcap">Talbot</span> and
twelve more, which were slain in this last encounter.</p>

<p>Of those [on the Left Wing] that fled, there were about
60 killed, and 300 taken prisoners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This business, having such ill success, our hopes of better
could not be much: wanting all things that were necessary
for defence, and [no] expectations of helps from any place.</p>

<p>The Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> presently lay siege to the town
[of Bradford]: but before he had surrounded it, I got in
with those men I brought from Halifax.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I found my father much troubled; having neither a Place
of Strength to defend ourselves in, nor a garrison in Yorkshire
to retreat to. For [Sir <span class="smcap">John Hotham</span> the Elder,] the
Governor of Hull had declared himself, If we were forced to
retreat thither, that he would shut the gates on us.</p>

<p>But, while he was musing on these sad thoughts, a messenger
was sent from Hull to let him know, The townsmen
had secured [<i>taken prisoner</i>] the Governor [on the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
of the 29th June 1643]; and if he had any occasion to make
use of that place, for they were sensible of the danger he was
in, he should be very readily and gladly received [there].
Which news was joyfully received, and acknowledged as a
great mercy of GOD to us: yet was it not made use of till
a further necessity compelled it.</p>

<p>So my father, having ordered me to stay here [at Bradford]
with 800 Foot and 60 Horse: he intruded [<i>retired</i>] that
night [of 30th June 1643] for Leeds, to secure it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, having spent three or four days in laying
his Quarters about the town; they brought down their
cannon: but needed to raise no batteries, for the hills, within
half [a] musket shot, commanded all the town; which [cannon],
now being planted in two places, shot furiously upon
us. [They] making also Approaches; which made us spend
very much [ammunition].</p>

<p>Our little store was not above five and twenty, or thirty,
barrels of powder at the beginning of the siege: yet, notwithstanding,
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> sent a Trumpet[er] to
offer us Conditions; which I accepted so they were honourable
for us to take, and safe for the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Upon which, two Captains were sent to treat with him,
and a Cessation [was agreed upon] during the time; but he
continued working still, contrary to [the] agreement: whereupon
I sent for the Commissioners again, suspecting a design
of attempting something against us; but he returned them
not till eleven a clock at night [of 1st July 1643], and then
with a slight answer.</p>

<p>Whilst they were delivering it to us, we heard great shooting
of cannon and muskets. All ran presently to the Works,
which the Enemy was storming. Here, for three-quarters of
an hour, was very hot service: but, at length they retreated.</p>

<p>They made a second attempt: but were also beaten off.</p>

<p>After this, we had not above one barrel of powder left;
and no Match. So I called the Officers together: where it
was advised and resolved [<i>evidently about 1 a.m. on the 2nd
July 1643</i>] to draw off presently, before it was day; and by
forcing a way, which we must do (they having surrounded
the town), [in order] to retreat to Leeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders were despatched, and speedily put in execution.</p>

<p>The Foot, commanded by Colonel <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, was sent out,
through some narrow lanes; who were to beat up the Dragoons'
Quarters [<i>Encampment</i>]; and so to go on to Leeds.</p>

<p>[I] myself, with some other Officers, went with the Horse,
which were not above 50, in an opener way.</p>

<p>Here I must not forget to mention my Wife, who ran
great hazards with us in this retreat as any others; and with
as little expression of fear: not from any zeal or delight, I
must needs say, in the War; but through a willing and
patient suffering of this undesirable condition.</p>

<p>But now I sent two or three Horsemen to discover what
they could of the Enemy: which presently returned, and
told us, There was a Guard of Horse close by us.</p>

<p>Before I had gone forty paces, the day beginning to break,
I saw them on the hill above us; being about 300 Horse.</p>

<p>I, with some 12 more, charged them. Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Foulis</span>,
Major General <span class="smcap">Gifford</span>, and myself, with three more [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>6
out of 13</i>] brake through. Captain <span class="smcap">Mudd</span> was slain: and
the rest of our Horse, being close by, the Enemy fell upon
them, taking most of them prisoners; amongst whom my
Wife was, the Officer behind whom she was [on horseback]
being taken.</p>

<p>I saw this disaster; but could give no relief. For after I
was got through, I was in the Enemy's Rear alone; for
those that had charged also through, went on to Leeds;
thinking I had done so too.</p>

<p>But being unwilling to leave my company: I stayed till I
saw there was no more in my power to do; but to be made
a prisoner with them. Then I retired to Leeds.</p>

<p>The like disorder fell amongst the Foot that went the
other way, by a mistake. For after they had marched a
little way, the Van fell into the Dragoons' Quarters [<i>Encampment</i>],
clearing the way. But through a cowardly
fear of him that commanded those men who were in the
Rear; [he] made them face about, and march again into the
town [of Bradford]: where, the next day [2nd July 1643],
they were all taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Only 80, or thereabouts, of the Front, which got through,
came to Leeds; all mounted on horses which they had taken
from the Enemy: where I found them when I came thither;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
which was some joy to them, all concluding I was either
slain or taken prisoner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I found all in great distraction here [<i>i.e., at Leeds</i>].</p>

<p>The Council of War was newly risen, where it was resolved
to quit the town, and make our retreat to Hull; which was
60 miles off, and many garrisons of the Enemy on the way.
Which, in two hours time was done: for we could expect no
less than that the Enemy should presently send Horse to
prevent it. For they had 50, or 60, Troops within three
miles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we got well to Selby; where there was a ferry: and,
hard by, a garrison at Cawood.</p>

<p>My father, being a mile before, with a few men getting
over the ferry; word came to us that he was in danger to
be taken. I hastened to him with about 40 Horse: the rest
[of the Horse] coming on after in some disorder. He was
newly got into the boat.</p>

<p>The Enemy, with 3 Cornets of Horse, entering the town;
I was drawn up in the Market Place, just before the street
they came down. When they were almost half come into
the Market Place, they turned on the right hand.</p>

<p>With part of my Troop, I charged them in the Flanks;
[and] so divided them. We had the chase of them down the
long street that goes to Brayton.</p>

<p>It happened, at the same time, [that] those men [which] I
left behind, were coming up that street: [but] being in disorder,
and under [the] discouragements of the misfortunes of
many days before, [they] turned about, and gave way; not
knowing that we were pursuing them in the rear. [<i>That is,
there were tearing along the Brayton road; (1) <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>'s
disordered Cavalry; then (2) the Royalist Cavalry; followed
by (3) <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> with a part of his Troop.</i>]</p>

<p>At the end of this street, was a narrow lane which led to
Cawood. The Enemy strove to pass away there; but [it]
being strait [<i>narrow</i>], caused a sudden stop: where we were
mingled one among another.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I received a shot in the wrist of my arm, which
made the bridle fall out of my hand: which [wound], being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
among the nerves and veins, suddenly let out such a quantity
of blood as that I was ready to fall from my horse. So
taking the reins in the other hand, wherein I had my sword;
the Enemy minding nothing so much as how to get away:
I drew myself out of the crowd, and came to our men that
turned about; which were standing hard by. Seeing me
ready to fall from my horse, they laid me on the ground:
and [I] now, [being] almost senseless. My Chirurgeon came
seasonably, and bound up the wound, [and] so stopped the
bleeding.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour's rest there, I got on horseback
again.</p>

<p>The other part of our Horse also beat the Enemy to
Cawood back again, that way they first came to us.</p>

<p>So, through the goodness of GOD, our passage here was
made clear. Some went over the ferry, after my father.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Myself, with others, went through the Levels [<i>of the Fen
Country, in North Lincolnshire; and south of the Humber</i>] to
Hull. But it proved a very troublesome and dangerous passage;
having oft interruptions from the Enemy; sometimes
in our front, sometimes in our rear.</p>

<p>And now I had been at least twenty hours on horseback,
after I was shot [at Selby], without any rest or refreshment:
and as many hours before. [<i>40 hours from 1 a.m. on the
night of 2nd July 1643, when <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> decided to cut his way
out of Bradford, would make it about 5 p.m. of the 3rd July
1643.</i>]</p>

<p>And, as a further addition to my affliction, my daughter
[<i><span class="smcap">Mary</span>, who afterwards married <span class="smcap">George Villiers</span>, second
Duke of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>, see p. 611</i>], not above five years old,
being carried before her maid, endured all this retreat on
horseback: but, Nature not [being] able to hold out any
longer, [she] fell into frequent swoonings; and [was], in
appearance, ready to expire her last [breath]. And having
now passed the Trent [<i>and therefore come into North Lincolnshire</i>],
and seeing a house not far off, I sent her, with
her maid only, thither: with little hopes of seeing her any
more alive; but intending, the next day, to send a ship from
Hull for her.</p>

<p>So I went on to Barton [<i>upon Humber: nearly opposite</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
<i>Hull</i>]; having sent before to have a ship ready against my
coming thither.</p>

<p>Here I lay down a little to rest; if it were possible to find
any in a body so full of pain; and [in] a mind so full of
anxiety and trouble. Though I must acknowledge it, as the
infinite goodness of GOD, methought my spirits were nothing
at all discouraged from doing still that which I thought to
be my work and duty.</p>

<p>But I had not laid [down] a quarter of an hour before the
Enemy came close to the town [of Barton]. I had now not
above 100 Horse with me. We went to the ship; where,
under the covert of her ordnance, we got all our men and
horses aboard.</p>

<p>So passing [the] Humber, we arrived at Hull; our men
faint and tired: [and I] myself having lost all, even to my
shirt; for my clothes were made unfit to wear, with rents
and the blood which was upon them. Considering which,
in all humility and reverence, I may say, I was in <span class="smcap">Job</span>'s condition
when he said, "Naked came I out of my mother's
womb, and naked shall I return thither. The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the Name of the
Lord." [<i>Job</i> i. 21.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But GOD, who is a GOD of Mercy and Consolation, doth
not always leave us in distress.</p>

<p>I having sent a ship, presently after I came into the town,
for my daughter: she was brought, the next day [4th July
1643], to Hull; pretty well recovered of her long and tedious
journey.</p>

<p>And, not many days after, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> sent
my Wife back again, in his coach, with some Horse to guard
her: which generosity gained more than any reputation he
could have gotten in detaining a Lady prisoner upon such
terms.</p>

<p>And many of our men, which were dispersed in this long
retreat, came hither again to us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our first business now, was to raise new forces: which, in
a short time, were about 1,500 Foot and 700 Horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<p>The town [of Hull] being little; I was sent to Beverley
with the Horse and 600 Foot.</p>

<p>But my Lord [of] <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, who now looked upon us as
inconsiderable, was marched with his whole Army into Lincolnshire:
only leaving some few garrisons at York and other
few places. He took in Gainsborough and Lincoln; and
intended [to take] Boston next, which was the Key of the
Associated Countries [<i>Counties</i>]. For his Orders, which I
have seen, were to go into Essex; and block up London on
that side.</p>

<p>But we, having laid a great while [<i>from 4th July to 26th
August 1643</i>] still, were now strong enough in the Field for
those forces that remained in the Country [<i>Yorkshire</i>]. So
we sent out a good party to make an attempt upon Stamford
Bridge, near York. But the Enemy, upon the alarm,
fled thither [<i>i.e. to York</i>]; which put them all there in such
a fear as they sent earnestly to desire him to return, or the
Country [<i>Yorkshire</i>] would again be lost: for the Lord
<span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> had considerable forces.</p>

<p>Upon which, he returned again into Yorkshire; and, not
long after, came to besiege Hull.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I, lying then at Beverley in the way of his march, finding
that we were not able to maintain such an open place against
an Army, desired Orders from my father to retire back to
Hull.</p>

<p>But the Committee there (having always more mind of
raising money, than to take care of the Soldiers; yet these
[Committee] Men had the greatest share in command at
this time) would not let any Orders be given for our retreat;
and [it were] unfit for us to return without [them].</p>

<p>The Enemy marcheth from York, with his whole Army,
towards us. Retreat, we must not. Keep the town, we
could not. So to make our retreat more honourable, and
useful both; I drew out all the Horse and Dragoons toward
the Enemy, and stood, drawn up by a wood side, all that
night.</p>

<p>The next morning [2nd September 1643], by day[time],
our Scouts, and theirs, fired on one another. They march[ed]
on with their whole body; which was about 4,000 Horse and
12,000 Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span></p>

<p>We stood till they were come very near [to] us. I then
drew off (having given directions before for the Foot to
march away toward Hull), thinking to make good the retreat
with the Horse.</p>

<p>The Enemy, with a good party, were upon our rear. The
lane being but narrow, we made good shift with them till we
got into Beverley, and shut the gates: which we had scarce
time to do; they being so close upon us. But, in this business,
we lost Major <span class="smcap">Layton</span>, and not above 2 more.</p>

<p>The Enemy, not knowing what forces we had in the town,
stayed till the rest of the Army came up; which was about
a mile behind. This gave our Foot some advantage in their
retreat: it being 5 miles to Hull, on narrow banks [and] so
fittest for our Foot. I sent the Horse by Cottingham, an
opener road; who got well thither.</p>

<p>But they [<i>the Royalists</i>] overtook the Foot: which, notwithstanding,
made good their retreat till we got to a little
bridge, 2 miles from Hull; where we made a stand.</p>

<p>The Enemy following close, our men here gave them a
good volley of shot; which made them draw back, and
advance no further. So, leaving a small Guard at the
bridge, we got safe to Hull.</p>

<p>Thus not only for want of military skill in the Gentlemen
of the Committee; but, to say no more, for want of good
nature: we were exposed to this trouble and danger.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My Lord of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> now lay siege to Hull, but at a
great distance. The sluices being open, drowned the land
two miles about the town: yet upon a bank, which was the
highway, he approached so near as to shoot cannon shot at
random into the town; which were, for the most part, fiery
bullets. But the diligence and care of the Governor (who
caused every inhabitant to watch his own house; and wheresoever
they saw these bullets fall, to be ready to quench them)
prevented the danger.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our Horse was now useless: and many [horses] died
every day; having nothing but salt water about the town.</p>

<p>I was therefore sent with the Horse, over [the Humber]
into Lincolnshire, to join with [<span class="smcap">Edward Montagu</span>,] the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>'s forces; which were then commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
by Major General [<span class="smcap">Oliver</span>] <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>: who received us
at our landing, with his troops.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">John Henderson</span> lay within three or four miles of
this place with 5,000 men, to prevent our conjunction: but
durst not attempt [it].</p>

<p>He marched three or four days near to us: but, for want
of good intelligence, we did not know so much. For I
altogether trusted to the care of our new friends, being a
stranger in those parts: till one morning [9th October 1643]
he set upon our Guards at Horncastle; which, being but
newly raised in that Country [<i>Lincolnshire</i>], fled towards
Lincoln, without giving any alarm to our Quarters, who lay
dispersed and secure.</p>

<p>But Sir <span class="smcap">John Henderson</span>, marching slowly with his
Army, gave the alarm to some of our Quarters; which
was soon taken by the rest: but, with some disorder,
before we could get into a considerable body. My Lord
<span class="smcap">Willoughby</span> with his Horse, and my Dragoons commanded
by Colonel <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, brought up the Rear. After
some skirmishes, we lodged that night all in the Field.</p>

<p>And, next day [10th October 1643], the Earl of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>
came to us with his Foot.</p>

<p>The day following [11th October 1643], we advanced
again towards the Enemy; and choosing a convenient ground
to fight on, we drew up the Army there. The Enemy did
so on the side of another hill close by, having a little plain
betwixt us.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General [<span class="smcap">Oliver</span>] <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> had the Van
[of Horse]; I, the Reserve [of Horse]: my Lord [of] <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>
all the Foot. After we had faced one another a
little while; the Forlorn Hopes [<i>Advanced Guards</i>] began
the fight. Presently the [Main] Bodies met in the plain:
where the fight was hot for half an hour; but then we
forced them to a rout. Above 200 killed, and 2000 taken
prisoners. This was the issue of Horncastle Fight, or, as
some call it, Winceby Fight.</p>

<p>At the same instant, we heard great shooting of ordnance
towards Hull: which was a sally my father made [out of the
town] upon my Lord of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s Trenches; who drew
out most part of his Army to relieve them. But our men
charged so resolutely as they possessed themselves of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
cannon; and so pursued their advantage as [they] put
the enemy into a total rout. Upon which, he raised the
Siege, and returned again to York.</p>

<p>These two defeats together, the one falling heavy on the
Horse, the other on the Foot, kept the Enemy all that
Winter [of 1643-1644] from attempting anything.</p>

<p>And we, after the taking of Lincoln, settled ourselves in
Winter Quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, in the coldest season of it, I was ordered by the Parliament
to go and raise the Siege of Nantwich; which the
Lord <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, with the Irish Army, had reduced to great
extremity.</p>

<p>I was the most unfit of all the forces; being ever the
worst paid; my men sickly, and almost naked for want
of clothes. I desired the Parliament that they would be
pleased to supply these wants: not to excuse myself, as
some who had no will to stir, though well enough accommodated
with all these; and a business of so much importance.
But their answer was a positive direction to march;
for it would admit of no delay: which indeed was as grievous
to me as that injunction was to the Israelites, to make bricks
without straw.</p>

<p>But, foreseeing I should have such a return to my desires,
I had, seeing the necessity of the business, upon my own
credit got so much cloth as clothed 1,500 men: and
[they were] all ready to march when these Orders came
to me.</p>

<p>So, the 29th of December [1643], we got forwards from
Falkingham in Lincolnshire to Nantwich, with 1,800 Horse
and 500 Dragoons; and a Power to call the Regiments [of
Foot] of Lancashire and Cheshire to make up the body of
the Army. But it was not a little trouble to me, when I
came to Manchester, to find some of them 30, some 40
miles distant: besides the disaffection of some of their
Colonels, who went as their peculiar [<i>individual</i>] safety or
Interest swayed them. But, finding more readiness in the
inferior Officers and common soldiers, I got up, in a few
days, near[ly] 3,000 Foot.</p>

<p>With this Army, we marched [from Manchester, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
21st January 1644] to Nantwich; which was at the point of
surrendering.</p>

<p>When we were within two days' march, I had intelligence
that the Lord <span class="smcap">Byron</span> had drawn off his Siege; and intended
to meet us in the Field. I put my men into the order I intended
to fight [in]; and so continued my march till we
came within 3 miles of the town.</p>

<p>There, was a Pass kept with about 250 men. I sent
Colonel <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, with his Dragoons, to beat them off: in
which, his brother, who was his Lieutenant, was slain. The
Major who commanded the other party, with some others,
were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>We marched on till we came within cannon shot of their
Works, where half of their Army was drawn up. The river
[Weaver], which runs through the town, being raised with
the melting of the snow, hindered, as we were informed,
those that lay on the other side of the town from joining
with them.</p>

<p>We called a Council [of War, on 25th January 1644]
wherein it was debated, Whether we should attempt those
in their Works [<i>Entrenchments</i>], being divided from the rest
of the Army: or march into the town and relieve them; and,
by increase of more force be better able, the next day [26th
January 1644] to encounter them.</p>

<p>The latter was resolved on. So, making a way with [the]
Pioneers through the hedges, we marched to[wards] the
town.</p>

<p>But, after we had gone a little way, word came that the
Enemy were in the Rear. So, facing about two Regiments
[of Foot] and my own Regiment of Horse, commanded by
Major <span class="smcap">Rousby</span>, we relieving those that were already engaged.
And so the fight began on all sides. These that
fell on our Rear were those that lay [on] the other side of
the town; which had passed the river [Weaver]. Those
that were drawn up under their Works [about Acton Church],
fell upon our Van, which was marching to the town. Thus
was the battle divided; there being a quarter of a mile
betwixt us.</p>

<p>In the division first engaged, our Foot, at the beginning,
gave a little ground: but our Horse recovered this, by beating
the Enemy's Horse out of the lanes that flanked our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
Foot; which did so encourage our men as they gained now
of the Enemy, so as they made them retire from hedge to
hedge till, at length, they were forced to fly to their Works
[<i>Entrenchments</i>]. But their Horse retreated in better order
towards Chester, without much loss.</p>

<p>Our other Wing [<i>the Van</i>], being assisted from the town,
who sallied out with 700 or 800 Musketeers, beat the Enemy
also back into the same Works [at Acton Church]; which we
presently surrounded. ["<i>Where</i>," <i>as Sir T. <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> said
in his despatch</i>, "<i>they were caught as in a trap</i>."]</p>

<p>But, being in great disorder and confusion, [they] sooner
yielded themselves prisoners; with all their Chief Officers,
arms, Colours, and ammunition.</p>

<p>Thus, by the mercy of GOD, was this victory obtained:
being yet the more signal in that we were not to deal with
young soldiers, but with men of great experience; and an
Army which had ever been victorious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this, we took in several garrisons in Cheshire:
Lathom [House] only in Lancashire held out; which was
besieged by the forces of that Country [<i>County</i>], but afterwards
[the siege was] raised by Prince <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having spent three or four months in this Expedition;
my father commanded me back into Yorkshire, that by the
conjunction of forces he might be the more able to take the
Field.</p>

<p>We met about Ferrybridge [in April 1644]: he being
come out of Hull thither, with intention to fall upon the
Enemy's garrison at Selby.</p>

<p>And here I received another Command from the Parliament,
to march immediately with my Horse and Dragoons,
into Northumberland, to join with the Scots Army. The
Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, who was then at Durham, being much
stronger in Horse than they; for want of which they
could not advance no further. But it being resolved, within
a day or two to storm Selby; I stayed till that business was
over: which proved as effectual for the relief of the Scots
Army.</p>

<p>The Governor of York lay in the town with 2,000 men.
We drew Horse and Foot close to it. Sir <span class="smcap">John Meldrum</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
led on the Foot; which had their General Posts appointed,
where they should storm: I, with the Horse, ready to second
them.</p>

<p>The Enemy within defended themselves [on the 11th
April 1644] stoutly a good while. Our men at length beat
them from the Line; but could not advance farther because
of the Horse within.</p>

<p>I getting a Barricado open, which let us in betwixt the
houses and the river. Here we had an encounter with their
Horse. [After one charge, they fled over a Bridge of Boats
to York.]</p>

<p>Other Horse came up, and charged us again, where my
horse was overthrown; [I] being single [<i>alone</i>] a little before
my men: who presently relieved me, and forced the Enemy
back; who retreated also to York. In this charge, we took
Colonel [Lord] <span class="smcap">Bellasis</span>, Governor of York.</p>

<p>By this, the Foot had entered the town; and also took
many prisoners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This good success put them into great distraction and
fears at York: who speedily sent to the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>,
to haste back thither; believing we would presently attempt
them. This news suddenly called him back, leaving the
Scots: who, with cold and oft alarms, were reduced to great
extremity; but now advanced without delay after him.</p>

<p>The Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> gets into York [on 19th April
1644].</p>

<p>The Scots joined their forces with my father's at Wetherby:
altogether making 16,000 Foot and 4,000 Horse. They
marched on to York [, from Tadcaster, on 19th April 1644].</p>

<p>But for this work, it was thought fit to have more men;
the town [of York] being large in compass, and strongly
manned. Therefore the Earl of <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>, [Lord] <span class="smcap">Lindsay</span>
and myself were sent to the Earl of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, to desire
him to join with us in the Siege: which he willingly consented
to, bringing an addition of 6,000 Foot and 3,000
Horse [on 2nd June 1644].</p>

<p>So now the Army had three Generals, [<span class="smcap">Alexander</span>]
<span class="smcap">Leslie</span> [, Earl of <span class="smcap">Leven</span>], <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, and <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>;
who lay apart in three Quarters before the town. But the
north side still remained open to the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time was spent here without any considerable action
till, in my Lord of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>'s Quarters, approaches
were made to St Mary's Tower; and soon came to mine it.
Which Colonel [<span class="smcap">Laurence</span>] <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>, a Scotsman, who
commanded that Quarter, (ambitious to have the honour alone
of springing the mine [on 16th June 1644] undertook, without
acquainting of the other two Generals with it, for their
advice and concurrence): which proved very prejudicial.
For, having engaged his party against the whole strength of
the town, without more force to second him, he was repulsed
with the loss of 300 men. For which, he had been surely
called to account; but that he escaped the better by reason
of this triumviral goverment.</p>

<p>So after, Prince <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> came to relieve the town. We
raised the siege [<i>which had lasted from Monday the 3rd June
to Monday the 1st July 1644</i>] and Hessa[y] Moor [<i>a portion
of Marston Moor, 7 miles from York</i>] being appointed the
rendezvous, the whole Army drew thither.</p>

<p>About a mile from whence, Prince <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> lay; the river
Ouse being only betwixt us: which he, that night, passed
over at Poppleton. And, the next day, [he] drew his Army
into the same Moor we were on: who, being now joined with
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s forces, made about 23,000 or 24,000
men. But we, something more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were divided in our opinions what to do. The English
were for fighting them; the Scots, for retreating, to gain (as
they alleged) both time and place of more advantage. This
latter being resolved on; we marched away [on Tuesday 2nd
July 1644] to[wards] Tadcaster; which made the Enemy to
advance the faster.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, Major General [<span class="smcap">David</span>]
<span class="smcap">Leslie</span>, and myself, being appointed to bring up the Rear;
we sent word to the Generals, of the necessity of making a
stand. For else, the Enemy, having the advantage, might
put us in some disorder; but, by the advantage of the
ground we were on, we hoped to make it good till they
came back to us.</p>

<p>[Which they did.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span></p>

<p>The place was Marston Fields, which afterwards gave the
name to this battle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here we drew up our Army. The Enemy was drawn up
in Battalia on the Moor a little below us.</p>

<p>The day being, for the most part, spent in preparation we
now began to descend toward them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> commanded the Left Wing
of Horse; and [was] seconded by Major General [<span class="smcap">David</span>]
<span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I had the Right Wing [of Horse], with some
Scotch Horse and Lances for my Reserves. The three
Generals were with the Foot.</p>

<p>Our Left Wing charged first the Enemy's Right Wing;
which was performed for a while with much resolution on
both sides; but the Enemy, at length, was put to the
worst.</p>

<p>Our Right Wing had not, all, so good success, by reason
of the whins [<i>furze</i>] and ditches which we were to pass over
before we could get to the Enemy, which put us into great
disorder: notwithstanding, I drew up a body of 400 Horse.
But because the intervals of [their] Horse, in this Wing only,
were lined with Musketeers; which did us much hurt with
their shot: I was necessitated to charge them. We were a
long time engaged one with another; but at last we routed
that part of their Wing. We charged, and pursued them a
good way towards York.</p>

<p>[I] myself only [<i>alone</i>] returned presently, to get to the
men I left behind me. But that part of the Enemy which
stood [opposite to them], perceiving the disorder they were
in, had charged and routed them, before I could get to them.
So that the good success we had at first was eclipsed much
by this bad conclusion.</p>

<p>But our other Wing, and most of the Foot, went on
prosperously till they had cleared the Field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I must not forget to remember with thankfulness
GOD's goodness to me this day. For having charged
through the Enemy, and my [400] men going after [in]
the pursuit; returning back [alone] to go to my other
troops, I was gotten in among the Enemy, which stood
up and down the Field in several bodies of Horse. So,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
taking the Signal [<i>a white handkerchief, or a piece of paper</i>]
out of my hat, I passed through, for one of their own Commanders;
and so got to my Lord of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>'s Horse
in the other Wing; only with a cut in my cheek which was
given me in the first charge, and a shot [which] my horse
received.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In which [first] charge also, many of my Officers and
soldiers were hurt and slain. The Captain of my own
Troop was shot in the arm. My Cornet had both his
hands cut, that rendered him ever after unserviceable. Captain
<span class="smcap">Mickelthwaite</span>, an honest stout man, was slain. And
[there was] scarce[ly] any Officer which was in this charge,
which did not receive a hurt.</p>

<p>But Colonel <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> (who should have seconded me;
but could not get up to me) charged in another place.
Major <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>, who was Major to his Regiment, had,
at least, thirty wounds: of which he died; after he was
abroad [<i>out of doors</i>] again, and [had] good hopes of his
recovery.</p>

<p>But that which nearest of all concerned me, was the loss
of my brother [<span class="smcap">Charles Fairfax</span>]: who, being deserted of
his men, was sore wounded; of which, in three or four days
after, he died.</p>

<p>So as, in this charge, as many were hurt and killed as in
the whole [Parliamentary] Army besides.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Enemy's part, there were above 4,000 slain, and
many taken prisoners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> returned into the South. The Earl of
<span class="smcap">Newcastle</span> went beyond the seas [on 5th July 1644], with
many of his Officers. York presently surrendered [on the
15th July 1644], and the North now was wholly reduced by
the Parliament's forces, except some garrisons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after this, I went to Helmsley, to take in the Castle
there: but received a dangerous shot in my shoulder; and
was brought back to York. All, for some time, being
doubtful of my recovery.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time, the Parliament voted me to command
in the South.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But my intention being only to keep in mind what I had
been present in, during this Northern War; I shall put an
end to this Discourse, where it pleased GOD to determine
my service there.</p>

<p>Yet thus, with some smart from his rod, to let me see I
was not mindful enough of returning my humble thanks
and acknowledgments for the deliverances and mercies I
received; and for which, alas, I am not yet capable enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
to praise him as I ought. [I] that may say by experience,
"Who is a GOD like unto our GOD?" [<i>Ps.</i> lxxi. 19.]
Therefore, "Not unto us, O Lord; not unto us, but unto
Thy Name; give we the praise!" [<i>Ps.</i> cxv.]
</p>
<p>
But as for myself, and what I have done, I may say with
<span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, "I looked on all the works that my hands have
wrought; and on the labour that I had laboured to do:
and, behold, all was Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. For
there is no remembrance of the Wise more than of the Fool
for ever; seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall
be forgotten." <i>Eccles.</i> ii. 16.

<i>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Slingsby</span> gives the following Account of this Action:</i>
</p>
<p>
My Lord of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span> sent out Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Glenham</span> once
again to beat up Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span>'s Quarters at Wetherby; commanding
out a party both of Horse and Dragoons. He comes close up
to the town, undiscovered, a little before sunrise; and <span class="smcap">Prideaux</span> and
some others enter the town through a back yard. This gave an alarm
quite through the town.
</p>
<p>
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span> was, at this juncture, drawing on his boots, to
go to his father at Tadcaster. He gets on horseback, draws out some
Pikes, and so meets our Gentlemen. Every one had a shot at him: he
only making at them with his sword; and then retired again, under the
guard of his Pikes.
</p>
<p>
At another part, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Norton</span> enters with his Dragoons.
Captain <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span> encounters him on horseback: the other
being on foot. They meet. <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span> missed with his pistol. <span class="smcap">Norton</span>
pulls him off horseback by the sword-belt. Being both on the
ground; <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span>'s soldiers come in, fell <span class="smcap">Norton</span> into the ditch
with the butt ends of their muskets, to rescue their Captain. <span class="smcap">Norton</span>'s
soldiers come in, and beat down <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span>; and with repeated blows
break his thigh; of which wound, he died. A sore scuffle between
two that had been neighbours and intimate friends. After this they
[<i><span class="smcap">Norton</span>'s Dragoons</i>] retreated out of the town; with the loss of more
than one Trooper killed, and one Major <span class="smcap">Carr</span>, a Scotchman.

<i>This is clearly wrong, and a slip of the memory. The Writer did
not again go to Bradford until after the Victory of the Club Men
there, on Sunday, 18th December 1642; which is thus described by
<span class="smcap">Ferdinando</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>, in a letter from Selby on 29th December
1642.</i>
</p>
<p>
I have formerly advertised that the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s Army have
seized upon Leeds: where they plunder the well-affected party; and
raise a very great sum of money out of those that they can draw to
compound for their securities.
</p>
<p>
And from Leeds, they marched on Sunday, the 18th of this month,
with 5 Troops of Horse, 6 Companies of Dragoons, 200 Foot, and two
drakes [<i>small cannon, or field pieces</i>], of the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>'s
Army; besides Sir <span class="smcap">William Savile</span> and divers other Gentlemen
of Yorkshire and their forces, that joined themselves with them: and
came to Bradford, about ten a clock in the morning; intending to
surprise the town, in [the] time of Prayer.</p>

<p>
But the town, having scouts abroad, had notice of their coming; and
gave the alarm to the country [<i>district</i>]: who came in to their succour
from the parts adjoining.
</p>
<p>
Yet they had not in all above 80 muskets: the rest being armed with
clubs and such rustic weapons; with which small force, they put the
cause to trial with [<i>against</i>] the great strength of the Enemy. Who
planted their drakes, and discharged each of them seventeen times
upon the town; until a townsman, with a fowling piece, killed one of
the Cannoniers. And then they all, with great courage, issued from the
town upon the enemies; and killed many of them, and took about 30
prisoners: and forced the rest to retreat, leaving 40 of their muskets
and [a] barrel of powder, with much other provision, behind them. And
this, with [the] loss of 3 Bradford men.
</p>
<p>
The report of the country is that [of] the enemies, amongst those that
were killed were Colonel <span class="smcap">Evers</span>, and Captain <span class="smcap">Binns</span>, and another Commander;
and that Colonel <span class="smcap">Goring</span>, General of the Horse with the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, was wounded; and Serjeant Major <span class="smcap">Carr</span>, taken
prisoner. And it is generally spoken, That 150 more are run away,
upon the retreat; and are not since returned to Leeds.
</p>
<p>
In which victory the hand and power of GOD was most evident, the
town being open on all sides and not defensible; assaulted on every
side by a malicious and bloody Enemy; and defended by a few half-naked
[<i>half-armed</i>] men: there being in the town not above 80 muskets
before they got 40 more by the spoils of their enemies; so that [the]
slaughter was, for the most part, with clubs and scythes mounted on
poles, and came to hand blows.
</p>
<p>
With this defeat, the enemies are so enraged as they threaten revenge
to Bradford.
</p>
<p>
Whereupon the Bradford men sent to me for succour of men and
arms. And I have sent my son [Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span>] and Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry Foulis</span> to them, with 3 Troops of Horse and 120 Dragooners;
who are safely arrived there: and [have been] received with great joy
and acclamation of the country [<i>district</i>]; who flock to him and offer
themselves most willingly to serve against their Popish enemies, if arms
could be furnished to them.
</p>
<p>
He hath already surprised some victuals [<i>convoys of provisions</i>] sent
in, upon warrants [<i>requisitions</i>], to the Enemy at Leeds, by the over-awed
country [<i>district</i>]. And he hath sent Captain <span class="smcap">Mildmay</span>, with his
Troop of Horse, into Craven [<i>i.e. the upper Wharfe-dale</i>] to stop the
raising of forces and money in that country: which is attempted by the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>; who is lately retired from York to Skipton.
And I hope he may leave nothing unattempted that may conduce to
the safety of the country, so far as can be expected from the few forces
he hath with him.

<p><i>Another Account of the Bradford Victory, dated 21st December 1642,
states:</i></p>

<p>
They appeared in Barker End, about 9 a clock, when we had not in
[the] town above 40 Musketeers; planted their ordnance in <span class="smcap">William
Cooke</span>'s Barn; marched down the Causey [<i>Causeway</i>] with their Foot,
whilst their Horse coasted about the town to hinder aid from coming
in; possessed themselves of those houses under the Church; and from
thence played hotly upon our Musketeers in the Church till 11 a clock:
about which time [the] Halifax men, and other neighbours, came in to
our help.
</p>
<p>
The fight, before hot, was then hotter. Our men, impatient to be
cooped up in the Church, rushed out [and] forced a passage into the
foresaid houses; and there our Club Men did good execution upon
them. Thereabouts the fight continued till it was dark. Many of
theirs were slain....
</p>
<p>
Their cannon, one of which shoots a 9 lb. ball [<i>if so, it was a Demi-Culverin:
see Vol. IV., p. 251</i>] played all that time upon the town: but
hurt no man, praised be GOD! who hath delivered those that were
ordained to death, &amp;c.

 <i>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Slingsby</span> says of this Fight:</i>
</p>
<p>
Two days after, His Excellency [the Earl of <span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>] came to
York [5th December 1642]; he undertook to attempt to beat Lord
<span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> out of Tadcaster: in this he succeeded pretty well [on 7th
December 1642]; and marched to Pomfret [<i>Pontefract</i>], which he
made his Head Quarters. His Horse [was] at Sherburn, and towns
next adjacent.
</p>
<p>
Here we were a little too secure. Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span> (with a party
of 300 Horse; and, it seems, hearing the Officers in Sherburn
were to have a feast) comes at noon-day, beats up our Quarters; [and]
takes Commissary <span class="smcap">Windham</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">William Riddall</span>, and many
others, prisoners.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On Tuesday last [13th December 1642], about four of the clock in the
morning, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span> marched from Selby; fetching a compass,
as if he declined Sherburn: yet, at last, [he] wheeled about, and
assaulted that town about one of the clock, the next day [14th December
1642] &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>A True Relation of the Fight at Sherburn, &amp;c.</i>

Saturday night, the 20th of May [1643]. The Lord General [i.e.
<span class="smcap">Ferdinando</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>] gave Order for a party of 1,000 Foot, 3
Companies of Dragooners, and 8 Troops of Horse, to march from the
garrisons of Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, and Howley. Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Fairfax</span> commanded in chief. The Foot were commanded by Serjeant Major General <span class="smcap">Gifford</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">William Fairfax</span>. The Horse were
divided into two bodies: 4 Troops commanded by Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span>,
and the other 4 Troops by Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Foulis</span>.
</p>
<p>
Howley was the rendezvous, where they all met on Saturday [20th
May] last, about twelve a clock at night.
</p>
<p>
About two, next morning, they marched away: and coming to
Stanley, where 2 of the Enemy's Troops lay, with some Dragooners;
that Quarter was beaten up, and about one and twenty prisoners taken.
</p>
<p>
About four a clock in the morning [of 21st May 1643], we came before
Wakefield. Where, after some of their Horse were beaten into the
town, the Foot, with unspeakable courage, beat the enemies from the
hedges, which they had lined with Muskeeters, into the town; and
assaulted it in two places, Wrengate and Norgate: and, after an hour
and a half's fight, we recovered [<i>captured</i>] one of their Pieces [of Ordnance]
and turned it upon them; and entered the town, at both places,
at one and the same time.
</p>
<p>
When the Barricadoes were opened, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Fairfax</span>, with the
Horse, fell into the town; and cleared the street: where Colonel
<span class="smcap">Goring</span> was taken by Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Alured</span>, brother to Captain <span class="smcap">Alured</span>,
a Member of the House [of Commons].
</p>
<p>
Yet in the Market Place, there stood 3 Troops of Horse; and Colonel
<span class="smcap">Lampton</span>'s Regiment: to whom Major General <span class="smcap">Gifford</span> sent a Trumpet[er],
with offer of Quarter, if they would lay down their arms.
</p>
<p>
They answered, They scorned the motion.
</p>
<p>
Then he fired a Piece of their own Ordnance upon them: and the
Horse fell in upon them, [and] beat them out of [the] town. We took
39 Officers, 27 Colours of Foot, 3 Coronets of Horse, and about 1,500
common soldiers.
</p>
<p>
The Enemy had in the town 3,000 Foot and 7 Troops of Horse:
besides Colonel <span class="smcap">Lampton</span>'s Regiment; which came into the town, after
we had entered the town.
</p>
<p>
The Enemy left behind them 4 Pieces of Ordnance, with Amunition;
which we brought away.

<p>
On this, Lord <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span> made the following marginal Note in his
copy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I envy none the honour they deservedly got in this battle; nor
am I ambitiously desirous of a branch of their laurel. But I see
no reason to be excluded [from] the Lists: in which I underwent
equal hazards with any others that day.
</p>
<p>
But [it] being my lot to be cast upon many disadvantages, having
command of the Right Wing, with much difficulty I could get but
5 Troops in order: with which I charged the Enemy's Left
Wing; when the business was hotly disputed a long time, at [the]
sword's point. We broke through; and had the chase of many
of them.
</p>
<p>
But, indeed, the rest of the Horse, [that] I could not draw up to
charge with me, were soon routed with that part of the Enemy we
left behind.
</p>
<p>
But to shew that some did their parts: having routed some of the
Enemy, and taken <span class="smcap">Goring</span>'s Major General prisoner; few of us
came off without dangerous wounds; and many [of them] were
mortal.
</p>
<p>
Which shews that the Right Wing did not wholly leave the
Field; as the Author of that book relates.</p>

fifth year of publication, with, as Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span> tells us, a sale
of 9,000 copies each quarter, and a paramount influence in British
society.
</p>
<p>
One usually looks to the reign of Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, to a <span class="smcap">Defoe</span>, a
<span class="smcap">Swift</span>, or an <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, for depth and subtilty of invention in
prose; but here it is in abundance: not so much, perhaps, in what is
so wittily said, as in the management and studied unfairness of the
pettifogging malignant sham Review; where everything is said that
ought to have been left out, and everything is left out that ought to have
been said.
</p>
<p>
The Writer, of course, would only take a noble Poem for such
maltreatment; and we must note the extreme liberality of his mind
that, being a strong Churchman, and also at that time Tutor of Oriel
College, Oxford, he selected a poem of the then scouted <span class="smcap">Milton</span> for his
example.
</p>
<p>Among the brilliant strokes of this Satire, two seem pre-eminent:
</p>

<p>(1) The designation of the Archangel of English Song as&mdash;<i>Mr. M.</i>
</p>
<p>(2) Speaking thus of one whose life and thought were Purity itself&mdash;<br />
<i>But we have already had occasion to remark on the laxity</i><br />
<i>of Mr M.'s amatory notions.</i>]</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em;"><span class="smcap">YOu</span> are now about to enter on a Profession</span>
which has the means of doing much good
to society, and scarcely any temptation to do
harm. You may encourage Genius, you may
chastise superficial Arrogance, expose Falsehood,
correct Error, and guide the Taste and
Opinions of the Age in no small degree by the books
you praise and recommend. And this too may be done
without running the risk of making any enemies; or subjecting
yourself to be called to account for your criticism,
however severe. While your name is unknown, your person
is invulnerable: at the same time your aim is sure, for you
may take it at your leisure; and your blows fall heavier
than those of any Writer whose name is given, or who is
simply anonymous. There is a mysterious authority in the
plural, <i>We</i>, which no single name, whatever may be its
reputation, can acquire; and, under the sanction of this
imposing style, your strictures, your praises, and your
dogmas, will command universal attention; and be received
as the fruit of united talents, acting on one common
principle&mdash;as the judgments of a tribunal who decide only
on mature deliberation, and who protect the interests of
Literature with unceasing vigilance.
</p>
<p>
Such being the high importance of that Office, and such
its opportunities; I cannot bestow a few hours of leisure
better than in furnishing you with some hints for the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
easy and effectual discharge of it: hints which are, I
confess, loosely thrown together; but which are the result
of long experience, and of frequent reflection and comparison.
And if anything should strike you, at first sight, as
rather equivocal in point of morality, or deficient in liberality
and feeling; I beg you will suppress all such scruples,
and consider them as the offspring of a contracted education
and narrow way of thinking, which a little intercourse
with the World and sober reasoning will speedily
overcome.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Now as in the conduct of life nothing is more to be
desired than some Governing Principle of action, to which
all other principles and motives must be made subservient;
so in the Art of Reviewing I would lay down as a fundamental
position, which you must never lose sight of, and
which must be the mainspring of all your criticisms&mdash;<i>Write
what will sell!</i> To this Golden Rule every minor
canon must be subordinate; and must be either immediately
deducible from it, or at least be made consistent with
it.
</p>
<p>
Be not staggered at the sound of a precept which, upon
examination, will be found as honest and virtuous as it
is discreet. I have already sketched out the great services
which it is in your power to render mankind; but all
your efforts will be unavailing if men did not read what
you write. Your utility therefore, it is plain, depends upon
your popularity; and popularity cannot be attained without
humouring the taste and inclinations of men.
</p>
<p>
Be assured that, by a similar train of sound and judicious
reasoning, the consciences of thousands in public life are
daily quieted. It is better for the State that their Party
should govern than any other. The good which they can
effect by the exercise of power is infinitely greater than
any which could arise from a rigid adherence to certain
subordinate moral precepts; which therefore should be
violated without scruple whenever they stand in the way of
their leading purpose. He who sticks at these can never
act a great part in the World, and is not fit to act it if he
could. Such maxims may be very useful in ordinary
affairs, and for the guidance of ordinary men: but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
we mount into the sphere of public utility, we must adopt
more enlarged principles; and not suffer ourselves to be
cramped and fettered by petty notions of Right and Moral
Duty.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
When you have reconciled yourself to this liberal way
of thinking; you will find many inferior advantages resulting
from it, which at first did not enter into your consideration.
In particular, it will greatly lighten your labours, to <i>follow</i>
the public taste, instead of taking upon you to <i>direct</i> it.
The task of Pleasing is at all times easier than that of
Instructing: at least it does not stand in need of painful
research and preparation; and may be effected in general
by a little vivacity of manner, and a dexterous morigeration
[<i>compliance, or obsequiousness</i>], as Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> calls it, to
the humours and frailties of men. Your responsibility too
is thereby much lessened. Justice and Candour can only
be required of you so far as they coincide with this Main
Principle: and a little experience will convince you that these
are not the happiest means of accomplishing your purpose.
</p>
<p>
It has been idly said, That a Reviewer acts in a judicial
capacity, and that his conduct should be regulated by the
same rules by which the Judge of a Civil Court is governed:
that he should rid himself of every bias; be patient, cautious,
sedate, and rigidly impartial: that he should not seek to
shew off himself, and should check every disposition to
enter into the case as a partizan.
</p>
<p>
Such is the language of superficial thinkers; but in reality
there is no analogy between the two cases. A Judge is
promoted to that office by the authority of the State; a
Reviewer by his own. The former is independent of
control, and may therefore freely follow the dictates of
his own conscience: the latter depends for his very bread
upon the breath of public opinion; the great law of self-preservation
therefore points out to him a different line
of action. Besides, as we have already observed, if he ceases
to please, he is no longer read; and consequently is no
longer useful. In a Court of Justice, too, the part of
amusing the bystanders rests with the Counsel: in the case
of criticism, if the Reviewer himself does not undertake
it, who will?
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span></p>
<p>
Instead of vainly aspiring to the gravity of a Magistrate;
I would advise him, when he sits down to write, to place
himself in the imaginary situation of a cross-examining
Pleader. He may comment, in a vain of agreeable irony,
upon the profession, the manner of life, the look, dress,
or even the name, of the witness he is examining: when
he has raised a contemptuous opinion of him in the minds
of the Court, he may proceed to draw answers from him
capable of a ludicrous turn; and he may carve and garble
these to his own liking.
</p>
<p>
This mode of proceeding you will find most practicable in
Poetry, where the boldness of the image or the delicacy
of thought (for which the Reader's mind was prepared
in the original) will easily be made to appear extravagant, or
affected, if judiciously singled out, and detached from the
group to which it belongs. Again, since much depends
upon the rhythm and the terseness of expression (both
of which are sometimes destroyed by dropping a single
word, or transposing a phrase), I have known much advantage
arise from <i>not</i> quoting in the form of a literal extract:
but giving a brief summary in prose, of the contents
of a poetical passage; and interlarding your own language,
with occasional phrases of the Poem marked with inverted
commas.
</p>
<p>
These, and a thousand other little expedients, by which
the arts of Quizzing and Banter flourish, practice will
soon teach you. If it should be necessary to transcribe
a dull passage, not very fertile in topics of humour and
raillery; you may introduce it as a "favourable specimen
of the Author's manner."
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Few people are aware of the powerful effects of what is
philosophically termed Association. Without any positive
violation of truth, the whole dignity of a passage may be
undermined by contriving to raise some vulgar and ridiculous
notions in the mind of the reader: and language
teems with examples of words by which the same idea
is expressed, with the difference only that one excites a
feeling of respect, the other of contempt. Thus you may
call a fit of melancholy, "the sulks"; resentment, "a pet";
a steed, "a nag"; a feast, "a junketing"; sorrow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
affliction, "whining and blubbering". By transferring the
terms peculiar to one state of society, to analogous situations
and characters in another, the same object is attained.
"A Drill Serjeant" or "a Cat and Nine Tails" in the Trojan
War, "a Lesbos smack putting into the Piræus," "the
Penny Post of Jerusalem," and other combinations of the
like nature which, when you have a little indulged in that
vein of thought, will readily suggest themselves, never fail
to raise a smile, if not immediately at the expense of the
Author, yet entirely destructive of that frame of mind which
his Poem requires in order to be relished.
</p>
<p>
I have dwelt the longer on this branch of Literature,
because you are chiefly to look here for materials of fun
and irony.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Voyages and Travels indeed are no barren ground; and
you must seldom let a Number of your <i>Review</i> go abroad
without an Article of this description. The charm of this
species of writing, so universally felt, arises chiefly from
its uniting Narrative with Information. The interest we
take in the story can only be kept alive by minute incident
and occasional detail; which puts us in possession of the
traveller's feelings, his hopes, his fears, his disappointments,
and his pleasures. At the same time the thirst for knowledge
and love of novelty is gratified by continual information
respecting the people and countries he visits.
</p>
<p>
If you wish therefore to run down the book, you have
only to play off these two parts against each other. When
the Writer's object is to satisfy the first inclination, you
are to thank him for communicating to the World such
valuable facts as, whether he lost his way in the night,
or sprained his ankle, or had no appetite for his dinner.
If he is busied about describing the Mineralogy, Natural
History, Agriculture, Trade, etc. of a country: you may
mention a hundred books from whence the same information
may be obtained; and deprecate the practice of emptying
old musty Folios into new Quartos, to gratify that sickly
taste for a smattering about everything which distinguishes
the present Age.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
In Works of Science and recondite Learning, the task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
you have undertaken will not be so difficult as you may
imagine. Tables of Contents and Indexes are blessed
helps in the hands of a Reviewer; but, more than all, the
Preface is the field from which his richest harvest is to
be gathered.
</p>
<p>
In the Preface, the Author usually gives a summary
of what has been written on the same subject before;
he acknowledges the assistance he has received from
different sources, and the reasons of his dissent from former
Writers; he confesses that certain parts have been less
attentively considered than others, and that information
has come to his hands too late to be made use of; he
points out many things in the composition of his Work
which he thinks may provoke animadversion, and endeavours
to defend or palliate his own practice.
</p>
<p>
Here then is a fund of wealth for the Reviewer, lying
upon the very surface. If he knows anything of his
business, he will turn all these materials against the Author:
carefully suppressing the source of his information; and
as if drawing from the stores of his own mind long ago
laid up for this very purpose. If the Author's references
are correct, a great point is gained; for by consulting a
few passages of the original Works, it will be easy to
discuss the subject with the air of having a previous knowledge
of the whole.
</p>
<p>
Your chief vantage ground is, That you may fasten
upon any position in the book you are reviewing, and
treat it as principal and essential; when perhaps it is of
little weight in the main argument: but, by allotting a
large share of your criticism to it, the reader will naturally
be led to give it a proportionate importance, and to consider
the merit of the Treatise at issue upon that single question.
</p>
<p>
If anybody complains that the greater and more valuable
parts remain unnoticed; your answer is, That it is impossible
to pay attention to all; and that your duty is rather to
prevent the propagation of error, than to lavish praises
upon that which, if really excellent, will work its way
in the World without your help.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, if the plan of your <i>Review</i> admits of selection,
you had better not meddle with Works of deep research
and original speculation; such as have already attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
much notice, and cannot be treated superficially without
fear of being found out. The time required for making
yourself thoroughly master of the subject is so great, that
you may depend upon it they will never pay for the
reviewing. They are generally the fruit of long study,
and of talents concentrated in the steady pursuit of one
object: it is not likely therefore that you can throw much
new light on a question of this nature, or even plausibly
combat the Author's propositions; in the course of a few
hours, which is all you can well afford to devote to them.
And without accomplishing one or the other of these points;
your <i>Review</i> will gain no celebrity, and of course no good
will be done.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Enough has been said to give you some insight into
the facilities with which your new employment abounds.
I will only mention one more, because of its extensive
and almost universal application to all Branches of Literature;
the topic, I mean, which by the old Rhetoricians
was called &#7952;&xi; &#7952;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;,
That is, when a Work excels in one quality; you may blame it
for not having the opposite.
</p>
<p>
For instance, if the biographical sketch of a Literary
Character is minute and full of anecdote; you may enlarge
on the advantages of philosophical reflection, and the
superior mind required to give a judicious analysis of the
Opinions and Works of deceased Authors. On the contrary,
if the latter method is pursued by the Biographer; you
can, with equal ease, extol the lively colouring, and truth,
and interest, of exact delineation and detail.
</p>
<p>
This topic, you will perceive, enters into Style as well
as Matter; where many virtues might be named <i>which
are incompatible</i>: and whichever the Author has preferred,
it will be the signal for you to launch forth on the praises
of its opposite; and continually to hold up that to your
Reader as the model of excellence in this species of Writing.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
You will perhaps wonder why all my instructions are
pointed towards the Censure, and not the Praise, of Books;
but many reasons might be given why it should be so.
The chief are, that this part is both easier, and will sell better.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us hear the words of Mr <span class="smcap">Burke</span> on a subject not
very dissimilar:
</p>

<p>
"In such cases," says he, "the Writer has a certain fire
and alacrity inspired into him by a consciousness that
(let it fare how it will with the subject) his ingenuity will
be sure of applause: and this alacrity becomes much greater,
if he acts upon the offensive; by the impetuosity that
always accompanies an attack, and the unfortunate propensity
which mankind have to finding and exaggerating
faults." Pref., <i>Vindic. Nat. Soc.</i>, p. 6.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
You will perceive that I have on no occasion sanctioned
the baser motives of private pique, envy, revenge, and
love of detraction. At least I have not recommended
harsh treatment upon any of these grounds. I have argued
simply on the abstract moral principle which a Reviewer
should ever have present to his mind: but if any of these
motives insinuate themselves as secondary springs of action,
I would not condemn them. They may come in aid of
the grand Leading Principle, and powerfully second its
operation.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
But it is time to close these tedious precepts, and to
furnish you with, what speaks plainer than any precept,
a Specimen of the Art itself, in which several of them
are embodied. It is hastily done: but it exemplifies well
enough what I have said of the Poetical department; and
exhibits most of those qualities which disappointed Authors
are fond of railing at, under the names of Flippancy,
Arrogance, Conceit, Misrepresentation, and Malevolence:
reproaches which you will only regard as so many acknowledgments
of success in your undertaking; and infallible
tests of an established fame, and [a] rapidly increasing
circulation.

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_small_i.png" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:0.2em;">IT has become a practice of late with a certain</span>
description of people, who have no visible means
of subsistence, to string together a few trite
images of rural scenery, interspersed with
vulgarisms in dialect, and traits of vulgar
manners; to dress up these materials in a Sing-Song jingle;
and to offer them for sale as a Poem. According to the most
approved recipes, something about the heathen gods and goddesses;
and the schoolboy topics of Styx and Cerberus, and
Elysium; are occasionally thrown in, and the composition is
complete. The stock in trade of these Adventurers is in general
scanty enough; and their Art therefore consists in disposing
it to the best advantage. But if such be the aim of the Writer,
it is the Critic's business to detect and defeat the imposture;
to warn the public against the purchase of shop-worn goods
and tinsel wares; to protect the fair trader, by exposing
the tricks of needy Quacks and Mountebanks; and to
chastise that forward and noisy importunity with which
they present themselves to the public notice.
</p>
<p>
How far Mr. <span class="smcap">Milton</span> is amenable to this discipline,
will best appear from a brief analysis of the Poem before us.
</p>
<p>
In the very opening he assumes a tone of authority
which might better suit some veteran Bard than a raw
candidate for the Delphic bays: for, before he proceeds
to the regular process of Invocation, he clears the way,
by driving from his presence (with sundry hard names;
and bitter reproaches on her father, mother, and all the
family) a venerable Personage, whose age at least and
staid matron-like appearance, might have entitled her to
more civil language.

</div></div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span></p>

<p>
There is no giving rules, however, in these matters, without
a knowledge of the case. Perhaps the old lady had been
frequently warned off before; and provoked this violence
by continuing still to lurk about the Poet's dwelling. And,
to say the truth, the Reader will have but too good reason
to remark, before he gets through the Poem, that it is one
thing to tell the Spirit of Dulness to depart; and another to
get rid of her in reality. Like <span class="smcap">Glendower</span>'s Spirits, any
one may order them away; "but will they go, when you do
order them?"
</p>
<p>
But let us suppose for a moment that the Parnassian
decree is obeyed; and, according to the letter of the <i>Order</i>
(which is as precise and wordy as if Justice <span class="smcap">Shallow</span>
himself had drawn it) that the obnoxious female is sent back
to the place of her birth,</p>

<p class="center">'Mongst horrid shapes, shrieks, sights, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>At which we beg our fair readers not to be alarmed; for
we can assure them they are only words of course in all
poetical Instruments of this nature, and mean no more
than the "force and arms" and "instigation of the Devil"
in a common Indictment.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
This nuisance then being abated; we are left at liberty
to contemplate a character of a different complexion,
"buxom, blithe, and debonair": one who, although evidently
a great favourite of the Poet's and therefore to be received
with all due courtesy, is notwithstanding introduced under
the suspicious description of an <i>alias</i>.

<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
Judging indeed from the light and easy deportment of this
gay Nymph; one might guess there were good reasons for
a change of name as she changed her residence.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
But of all vices there is none we abhor more than that of
slanderous insinuation. We shall therefore confine our
moral strictures to the Nymph's mother; in whose defence
the Poet has little to say himself. Here too, as in the case
of the <i>name</i>, there is some doubt. For the uncertainty
of descent on the Father's side having become trite to a
proverb; the Author, scorning that beaten track, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
left us to choose between two mothers for his favourite:
and without much to guide our choice; for, whichever
we fix upon, it is plain she was no better than she
should be.  As he seems however himself inclined to
the latter of the two, we will even suppose it so to be.

<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
Some dull people might imagine that <i>the wind</i> was more
like <i>the breath of Spring</i>; than <i>Spring, the breath of the
wind</i>: but we are more disposed to question the Author's
Ethics than his Physics; and accordingly cannot dismiss
these May gambols without some observations.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, Mr. M. seems to have higher notions
of the antiquity of the May Pole than we have been
accustomed to attach to it. Or perhaps he sought to
shelter the equivocal nature of this affair under that
sanction. To us, however, who can hardly subscribe to
the doctrine that "Vice loses half its evil by losing all
its grossness"; neither the remoteness of time, nor the
gaiety of the season, furnishes a sufficient palliation.
"Violets blue" and "fresh-blown roses" are, to be sure,
more agreeable objects of the Imagination than a gin shop
in Wapping or a booth in Bartholomew Fair; but, in point
of morality, these are distinctions without a difference:
or it may be the cultivation of mind (which teaches us to
reject and nauseate these latter objects) aggravates the case,
if our improvement in taste be not accompanied by a proportionate
improvement of morals.
</p>
<p>
If the Reader can reconcile himself to this latitude of
principle, the anachronism will not long stand in his way.
Much indeed may be said in favour of this union of ancient
Mythology with modern notions and manners. It is a
sort of chronological metaphor&mdash;an artificial analogy, by
which ideas, widely remote and heterogeneous, are brought
into contact; and the mind is delighted by this unexpected
assemblage, as it is by the combinations of figurative
language.

<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
And far be it from us to deny the use of so reasonable
a liberty; especially if the request be backed (as it is in
the case of Mr. M.) by the craving and imperious necessities
of rhyme. What man who has ever bestrode Pegasus for
an hour, will be insensible to such a claim?

We are next favoured with an enumeration of the
Attendants of this "debonair" Nymph, in all the minuteness
of a German <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>, or a Ropedancer's
Handbill.

<p><span class="i0">Haste thee, Nymph; and bring with thee</span>

</div></div></div></div>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
The Author, to prove himself worthy of being admitted
of the crew, skips and capers about upon "the light
fantastic toe," that there is no following him. He scampers
through all the Categories, in search of his imaginary
beings, from Substance to Quality, and back again; from
thence to Action, Passion, Habit, &amp;c. with incredible
celerity. Who, for instance, would have expected <i>cranks</i>,
<i>nods</i>, <i>becks</i>, and <i>wreath&egrave;d smiles</i> as part of a group in
which Jest, Jollity, Sport, and Laughter figure away as
full-formed entire Personages? The family likeness is
certainly very strong in the two last; and if we had
not been told, we should perhaps have thought the
act of <i>deriding</i> as appropriate to Laughter as to Sport.

<p class="center">But how are we to understand the stage directions?<br />

</p>

<p>
Are the words used synonymously? Or is it meant that
this airy gentry shall come in a Minuet step, and go off in a
Jig? The phenomenon of a <i>tripping crank</i> is indeed novel,
and would doubtless attract numerous spectators.
</p>
<p>
But it is difficult to guess to whom, among this jolly
company, the Poet addresses himself: for immediately after
the Plural appellative <i>you</i>, he proceeds,

<p>
No sooner is this fair damsel introduced; but Mr M., with
most unbecoming levity, falls in love with her: and makes
a request of her companion which is rather greedy, that
he may live with both of them.
</p>

<p class="center">To live with her, and live with thee.
</p>

<p>
Even the gay libertine who sang "How happy could I be
with either!" did not go so far as this. But we have
already had occasion to remark on the laxity of Mr M.'s
amatory notions.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
The Poet, intoxicated with the charms of his Mistress,
now rapidly runs over the pleasures which he proposes to
himself in the enjoyment of her society. But though he
has the advantage of being his own caterer, either his palate
is of a peculiar structure, or he has not made the most
judicious selection.
</p>

<p>To begin the day well, he will have the <i>sky-lark</i></p>

</div></div></div></div>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
The sky-lark, if we know anything of the nature of that bird,
must come "in spite" of something else as well as "of
sorrow," to the performance of this office.
</p>
<p>
In the next image, the Natural History is better preserved;
and, as the thoughts are appropriate to the time of day, we
will venture to transcribe the passage, as a favourable
specimen of the Author's manner:
</p>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="i0">While the Cock, with lively din,</span>
<span class="i0">Scatters the rear of darkness thin,</span>
<span class="i0">And to the stack, or the barn door,</span>
<span class="i0">Stoutly struts his dames before;</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Oft listening how the hounds and horns</span>

<span class="i0">Through the high wood echoing still.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
Is it not lamentable that, after all, whether it is the Cock, or
the Poet, that listens, should be left entirely to the Reader's
conjectures? Perhaps also his embarrassment may be increased
by a slight resemblance of character in these two
illustrious Personages, at least as far as relates to the extent
and numbers of their seraglio.

After a <i>flaming</i> description of sunrise, on which the clouds
attend in their very best liveries; the Bill of Fare for the day
proceeds in the usual manner. Whistling Ploughmen, singing
Milkmaids, and sentimental Shepherds are always to be
had at a moment's notice; and, if well grouped, serve to fill
up the landscape agreeably enough.
</p>
<p>
On this part of the Poem we have only to remark, that

<p>he will either find himself egregiously disappointed; or he
must possess a disposition to merriment which even
<span class="smcap">Democritus</span> himself might envy. To such a pitch indeed
does this solemn indication of joy sometimes rise, that we are
inclined to give him credit for a literal adherence to the
Apostolic precept, "Is any merry, let him sing Psalms!"

<p>
At length, however, he hies away at the sound of bell-ringing,
and seems for some time to enjoy the tippling and
fiddling and dancing of a village wake: but his fancy is
soon haunted again by spectres and goblins, a set of beings
not, in general, esteemed the companions or inspirers of mirth.

Mr. M. seems indeed to have a turn for this species of
Nursery Tales and prattling Lullabies; and, if he will
studiously cultivate his talent, he need not despair of figuring
in a conspicuous corner of Mr <span class="smcap">Newbery</span>'s shop window:
unless indeed Mrs. <span class="smcap">Trimmer</span> should think fit to proscribe
those empty levities and idle superstitions, by which the
World has been too long abused.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
From these rustic fictions, we are transported to another
species of <i>hum</i>.
</p>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<a id="Towered_cities"></a>
<span class="i0">Towered cities please us then,</span>
<span class="i0">And the busy hum of men;</span>
<span class="i0">Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,</span>
<span class="i0">In woods of peace, high triumphs hold:</span>
<span class="i0">With <i>store of Ladies</i>, whose bright eyes</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rain influence</i>, and judge the Prize</span>
<span class="i0">Of Wit or Arms; while both contend</span>
<span class="i0">To win her grace, whom all commend.</span>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
To talk of the bright eyes of Ladies judging the Prize of
Wit is indeed with the Poets a legitimate species of humming:
but would not, we may ask, the <i>rain</i> from these Ladies'
bright eyes rather tend to dim their lustre? Or is there any
quality in a shower of <i>influence</i>; which, instead of deadening,
serves only to brighten and exhilarate?
</p>
<p>
Whatever the case may be, we would advise Mr. M. by all
means to keep out of the way of these "Knights and Barons
bold": for, if he has nothing but his Wit to trust to, we will
venture to predict that, without a large share of most undue
influence, he must be content to see the Prize adjudged to
his competitors.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span></p>
<p>
Of the latter part of the Poem little need be said.
</p>
<p>
The Author does seem somewhat more at home when he
gets among the Actors and Musicians: though his head is
still running upon <span class="smcap">Orpheus</span> and <span class="smcap">Eurydice</span> and <span class="smcap">Pluto</span>, and
other sombre personages; who are ever thrusting themselves
in where we least expect them, and who chill every rising
emotion of mirth and gaiety.
</p>
<p>
He appears however to be so ravished with this sketch of
festive pleasures, or perhaps with himself for having sketched
them so well, that he closes with a couplet which would not
have disgraced a <span class="smcap">Sternhold</span>.
</p>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>

<span class="i0">Mirth, with thee I <i>mean</i> to live.</span>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
Of Mr. M.'s good <i>intentions</i> there can be no doubt; but we
beg leave to remind him that there are two opinions to be
consulted. He presumes perhaps upon the poetical powers
he has displayed, and considers them as irresistible: for every
one must observe in how different a strain he avows his
attachment now, and at the opening of the Poem. Then it was

<div class="topspace-1"></div>
<p>
But having, it should seem, established his pretensions; he
now thinks it sufficient to give notice that he means to live
with her, because he likes her.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Upon the whole, Mr. <span class="smcap">Milton</span> seems to be possessed of
some fancy and talent for rhyming; two most dangerous
endowments which often unfit men for acting a useful part
in life without qualifying them for that which is great and
brilliant. If it be true, as we have heard, that he has declined
advantageous prospects in business, for the sake of indulging
his poetical humour; we hope it is not yet too late to prevail
upon him to retract his resolution. With the help of <span class="smcap">Cocker</span>
and common industry, he may become a respectable
Scrivener: but it is not all the <span class="smcap">Zephyrs</span>, and <span class="smcap">Auroras</span>, And
<span class="smcap">Corydons</span>, and <span class="smcap">Thyrsis</span>'s; aye, nor his "junketing Queen
<span class="smcap">Mab</span>" and "drudging Goblins," that will ever make him a
Poet.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
